I had met (made acquintance with) Andrei back in my student years, in Paris. He was a capable man: some of his pictures were (оценены) thought highly of by very competent people, who usually were not wrong in their judgements and predicted a brilliant future for Andrei. Two or three poems, which he had written in several weeks, were no less outstanding (remarkable, marvelous), than his pictures. But he didn't have, enough creative or spiritual strength to bring (что бы то ни  было до конца) whatever he was working on to completion, and time proved, that both those who (praised, appraised) his pictures, and those who found outstanding qualities in his poetry, were sorely mistaken - not in their (judgements, assement) of esthethic merits, but in that Andrei was destined for a brilliant future in art or in literature. But in those distant times we all believed in the future and Andrei (в этом смысле) in that sense, was not an exception. Considerations regarding art (esthetics) played a very significant role in his life. But still the chief (главное место) role in his existence took up those impetuous feelings, to which he was inclined and which drove of (forced out) questions of esthetical nature to the (второй план) background. 
    Approximately (в эти же времена) during these very times, in the Latin quarter (neighborhood) and on Monparnasse (?) began to appear a certain Woman, who was fated to play a very significant role in the life on Andrei. One time when she was walking through the cafe, with hear head lifted and gazing (steadily) straight ahead, one of our mates (companions), said that she resembles Solomeya. From that point in time no one amongst us called her otherwise (anything but that, any differently). By the way, there was something accurate in that remark: from the side it seemed (looked, appeared) as if the woman really was carrying an invisible tray (salver?) in her arms. She was very beautiful. She was so beautiful, that even her ridiculous make-up - instead of brows she had two thin black lines, drawn with a black pencil and sharply (abruptly) bending upwards, her lips she painted (made-up) with carmine, which was prevailingly purple, - even this make up failed to produce that (murderous?) impression, which it should have produced (should by all means). Her hair was colored in a pale-yellow color. Later, having made a closer acquintance with her, I learned, that every morning she spent (did no less work) no less time on her face, than an actor (might), applying make-up before emerging onto the stage. This, nevertheless (however), did not prevent her from repeating, that her appearance does not interest her in the least. But of course, if (everything ?) was confined only to her appearance, she would not have had such success, as the one which accompanied her, where she might appear. Her surname was Martin, she spoke french with mistakes and in a foreign accent. Martin she was on account of her husband, who we never saw and who we did not know anything about. When the conversation turned towards that subject (him), she would said, that he no longer exists, exactly like that - il n'existe plus, - although this did not neccesarily mean that he was dead. She herself was romanian by nationality, in addition, I think, with a mix of gypsy and jewish blood. She joined the historico-philological department of Sorbonne as an (auditor, irregular student), as in her words, she had certain (недоразумения с аттестатом зрелости). Sometime later I came to understand (realize), that there never was a diploma and never could have been, although she did say, she had finished some kind of (среднее учебное заведение) in Romonia. She had no clue about such elementary things such as the speed of light, the difference between an arthimetic and a geometric progression, logarithms or the law of gravity. But in the areas of art she had a learning (knowledge) that was as vast (wide, extensive), as it was surprising. At any rate, that was all she was interested in, everything else to her, did not seem to be deserving (worth) the effort (заслуживающим внимания). She had very little money, she lived in a small hotel of the Latin quarter. From where she obtained those meager funds for life, which were at her disposal, remained a mystery, until at one point and entirely accidentally (by chance) it was cleared up (выяснилось), that every month she received a small sum from that former husband, which, as she said, did not exist. In those times she was twenty-two or twenty-three years old. 
That, I think, which she completely could not stand, or so it seemed, was simplicity. Simplicity in art or in human relationships seemed to her to be something (abhorently, demeaningly) primitative. This became apparent (exhibited) in even the most ordinary conversations- for example she would never answer a question such as: 
    "Will you be at the university tomorrow?"
It was as if she was not capable of giving a straight answer - yes I will be,- or no, I won't be. She would say: "Why does it interest you?" Or: "What difference does it make to you?" Because of this (trait) any kind of protracted (companionship?) with her was tiresome (wearisome), even though (несмотря на то), she was at times a most interesting interlocutor.
    She had large gray eyes, with an invariably cross expression, and even in her laughter one could hear a tint (hue, subtle note) of some-kind of incomprehensible, and essentially, objectless ire. Many of her actions were distinguished by their irritating inconsistency. She would agree (make a date) to go with someone to the cinema, they went by her hotel, and she turned out to be away, or she left a note - I changed my mind. She promised she would come (somewhere) and did not. But in others she never forgave inconsistencies or imprecision. (Although) to her it was most often forgiven - because not one of us had any doubts, that behind (beyond) this irksome (irksome, agitating, irritating) external (неприемлемостью) character must exist or cannot not exist a whole world, the emotional intensity of which was at the sametime indisputible and irresistibly tempting. One only had to (conquer, surpass, surmount, overcome) the external obstacles (barriers). And for this, to finally penetrate into that world, this was, of course worth doing ( это, конечно, стоило сделать). 
If not every was convinced of this, or rather, were not totally convinced, then Andrei was ready for any kind of trial for this (готов на любое испытание). From the side (looking at it) one could have thought, that he was created (именно для того) as if entirely (specifically) to become her victim. From the very beginning there was established that, which determined their relationship: she was allowed (permitted everything), and he wans't forgiven a single mistake. Which is to say that a mistake could be anything: a certain intonation, a insufficiently quick or imprecise answer, (неверное движение), - anything at all. He once came to me (сияющим  видом) with an ecstatic expresion, and said that Solomeya finalled agreed to receive as a present a book of poetry from him, the choice of which she gave to him. But when I met him the next day he was grim, (sad, mournful, miserable) unhappy, and not talkative (taciturn). 
- What book did you buy her and how was it received? - I asked. He shrugged his shoulders, sighed and replied, that he had bought her Verlaine. She had returned the book to him, saying, that she had no need for it, and (on top of it, при этом) besides, (would he be so good as) she would prefer that he did not visit her anymore. He went away in despair, entirely clueless, as to the cause for her sudden and inexplicable temper. Everytime he called her on the phone, she, recognizing his voice, immedietly hung up the receiver. 
    - Let her go to the devil, - (Да пошли ты ее к дьяволу), - I said, when he told me about this.
    - I don't have the (means, resources, possibility, ability) emotional capability to do that, - he answered, - If you knew her better, you would understand why. 
    I felt bad for him, I asked Solomeya, why she was so harsh (cruel) with him.   
I wanted him to by me Heredia, - she said, - and he's a fool, and couldn't figure it out. 
I related this to him. Then he bought her a couple of books, Heredia (в  том  числе) amongst them, and left the bag for her at her hotel. A few days later he decided to call her again. He stood at the telephone, swallowing saliva from anxiety (глотая от  волнения  слюну), and waiting for an answer. She said: 
    - Why haven't you called for so long? I've missed you. 
    The first time he embraced her, she slapped him and said, that this was so low an act that she didn't expect it even from him, and that everything was over between them. After this he didn't sleep for two nights. On the evening of the third day she came to him - he had a small apartment by the (Булонского леса), in which he lived alone. She entered, looked at him with her ireful eyes and kissed him avidly (жадно). She spent all night with him, and early morning he took her home by taxi to her hotel. After this, drunk from rapture (ecstacy) he came to see me, woke me from sleep and started to yell (кричать), that I could never understand, that I cannot imagine, what it's like... I had went to bed late, and really wanted to sleep, besides, I actually didn't understand, what could have brought him to such a state. When he finally explained to me, what the deal was (в чем дело, matter was), I only said to him: 
- Well, I wish you (all) future hapiness, dear friend, - and fell back alseep. When I awoke he was no longer there, but the ashtray was filled with butts - he, by all appearances, had spent a couple hours in my room, restoring in memory everything, which had occured (the details of), and thinking about his (ослепите- льном) happiness. 
    Much later, trying to understand (imagine), what in essence, determined that ridiculous (abusrd) way of living (life), by which Solomeya lived and to which, when she could, she compelled others, I came to the conclusion, that it was the desire to not accept what was happening, but to create that, which ought to happen. He with whom she began a conversation, who she had thought about (earlier, in the past), had to answer exactly (was expected), as she had imagined it prior (before, earlier). That, which happned, had to happen exactly as it had happened in her imagination. In all of this was some kind of absurd and incurable egocentricism: and for the actions and behaviour of a person to coincide with her (imagination, notions, ideas, expectations) ideas, they would have to cease to be themselves and become something akin to a book, which she had written. This, of course, could not be, she knew this (perfectly well) and understood (it to be so, ?), but this inevitably brought her into a fury (wrath). More so (Besides this), she determindely (doggedly, steadfastly) refused to take responsibility for her actions and for the conclusions which might be drawn from them. When Andrei, came to her on the next evening and put his hand on her shoulder, she threw it off with an abrupt motion, and told him, that she would like him never to do that again. Again he fell into despair - a state, into which he (tranfered?) often and very easily. This time around it continued for five days, than there was a repetition of - (повторилось  то,  что  было  у  него  на квартире). After a certain time he lost notion (conception) of reality entirely, did not know any thing was not sure of anything, except that, outside of Solomeya his life did not have any meaning. (Это было в известной степени
верно) This was true (correct) to a certain extent: without Solomeya his life really did not have any meaning. But with Solomeya as well - to which, he however (of course, nevertheless, однако) would never have agreed (assented). 
    - You are, of course, not the person, whom I really need, - she told him once. - You understand, he to whom I would give myself entirely, would foremost need to above (above, better) than me in all ways. All the time I would not to be conscious of his intellectual and physical superiority over me. His understanding of art (понимание искусства) would need to be flawless. The movements of his spirit would move me with them. It would have to be a person, who is exceptional amongst all others. You understand? And what do you offer? You have some talents (qualities), but tht's all. That's not enough for me. 
Sometime afterwards, Andrei received note, that his father, living in (Тулузе) was seriously ill. Andrei showed Salomeya the telegram from the doctor and said, that he must go to (Toulouse?) and came to say farewell to her. She glanced at him with her ireful eyes and asked: 
    - Do you really think, that I would leave you in such a time? (Неужели) Did you really doubt, that I would go with you? You will present me to your father as your bride. 
She actually did go to Toulouse with Andrei and spent a whole two months there, during which Andrei's faher was dying from cancer of the liver. She displayed extraordinary selflessness, didn't leave his bedsides, didn't sleep for nights - and when, after the funeral, they returned to Paris, Andrei, on but a word, was ready to do anything she should ask. I thought then that he was right, when he once told me, that Solomeya was capable of anything and that her actions could not be predicted. 
Once he told her, having gathered enough courage: - You consider yourself more intelligent than everyone, that you know? - No, - she said. - I don't consider myself especially intelligent. I only consider others to be stupid, at any rate - most of them (many).
    - Except for that theoretical person, which you need? 
    - Except for that person, - said Solomeya.
