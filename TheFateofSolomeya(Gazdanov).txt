I had met (made acquintance with) Andrei back in my student years, in Paris. He was a capable man: some of his pictures were (оценены) thought highly of by very competent people, who usually were not wrong in their judgements and predicted a brilliant future for Andrei. Two or three poems, which he had written in several weeks, were no less outstanding (remarkable, marvelous), than his pictures. But he didn't have, enough creative or spiritual strength to bring (что бы то ни  было до конца) whatever he was working on to completion, and time proved, that both those who (praised, appraised) his pictures, and those who found outstanding qualities in his poetry, were sorely mistaken - not in their (judgements, assement) of esthethic merits, but in that Andrei was destined for a brilliant future in art or in literature. But in those distant times we all believed in the future and Andrei (в этом смысле) in that sense, was not an exception. Considerations regarding art (esthetics) played a very significant role in his life. But still the chief (главное место) role in his existence took up those impetuous feelings, to which he was inclined and which drove of (forced out) questions of esthetical nature to the (второй план) background. 
    Approximately (в эти же времена) during these very times, in the Latin quarter (neighborhood) and on Monparnasse (?) began to appear a certain Woman, who was fated to play a very significant role in the life on Andrei. One time when she was walking through the cafe, with hear head lifted and gazing (steadily) straight ahead, one of our mates (companions), said that she resembles Salome. From that point in time no one amongst us called her otherwise (anything but that, any differently). By the way, there was something accurate in that remark: from the side it seemed (looked, appeared) as if the woman really was carrying an invisible tray (salver?) in her arms. She was very beautiful. She was so beautiful, that even her ridiculous make-up - instead of brows she had two thin black lines, drawn with a black pencil and sharply (abruptly) bending upwards, her lips she painted (made-up) with carmine, which was prevailingly purple, - even this make up failed to produce that (murderous?) impression, which it should have produced (should by all means). Her hair was colored in a pale-yellow color. Later, having made a closer acquintance with her, I learned, that every morning she spent (did no less work) no less time on her face, than an actor (might), applying make-up before emerging onto the stage. This, nevertheless (however), did not prevent her from repeating, that her appearance does not interest her in the least. But of course, if (everything ?) was confined only to her appearance, she would not have had such success, as the one which accompanied her, where she might appear. Her surname was Martin, she spoke french with mistakes and in a foreign accent. Martin she was on account of her husband, who we never saw and who we did not know anything about. When the conversation turned towards that subject (him), she would said, that he no longer exists, exactly like that - il n'existe plus, - although this did not neccesarily mean that he was dead. She herself was romanian by nationality, in addition, I think, with a mix of gypsy and jewish blood. She joined the historico-philological department of Sorbonne as an (auditor, irregular student), as in her words, she had certain (недоразумения с аттестатом зрелости). Sometime later I came to understand (realize), that there never was a diploma and never could have been, although she did say, she had finished some kind of (среднее учебное заведение) in Romonia. She had no clue about such elementary things such as the speed of light, the difference between an arthimetic and a geometric progression, logarithms or the law of gravity. But in the areas of art she had a learning (knowledge) that was as vast (wide, extensive), as it was surprising. At any rate, that was all she was interested in, everything else to her, did not seem to be deserving (worth) the effort (заслуживающим внимания). She had very little money, she lived in a small hotel of the Latin quarter. From where she obtained those meager funds for life, which were at her disposal, remained a mystery, until at one point and entirely accidentally (by chance) it was cleared up (выяснилось), that every month she received a small sum from that former husband, which, as she said, did not exist. In those times she was twenty-two or twenty-three years old. 
That, I think, which she completely could not stand, or so it seemed, was simplicity. Simplicity in art or in human relationships seemed to her to be something (abhorently, demeaningly) primitative. This became apparent (exhibited) in even the most ordinary conversations- for example she would never answer a question such as: 
    "Will you be at the university tomorrow?"
It was as if she was not capable of giving a straight answer - yes I will be,- or no, I won't be. She would say: "Why does it interest you?" Or: "What difference does it make to you?" Because of this (trait) any kind of protracted (companionship?) with her was tiresome (wearisome), even though (несмотря на то), she was at times a most interesting interlocutor.
    She had large gray eyes, with an invariably cross expression, and even in her laughter one could hear a tint (hue, subtle note) of some-kind of incomprehensible, and essentially, objectless ire. Many of her actions were distinguished by their irritating inconsistency. She would agree (make a date) to go with someone to the cinema, they went by her hotel, and she turned out to be away, or she left a note - I changed my mind. She promised she would come (somewhere) and did not. But in others she never forgave inconsistencies or imprecision. (Although) to her it was most often forgiven - because not one of us had any doubts, that behind (beyond) this irksome (irksome, agitating, irritating) external (неприемлемостью) character must exist or cannot not exist a whole world, the emotional intensity of which was at the sametime indisputible and irresistibly tempting. One only had to (conquer, surpass, surmount, overcome) the external obstacles (barriers). And for this, to finally penetrate into that world, this was, of course worth doing ( это, конечно, стоило сделать). 
If not every was convinced of this, or rather, were not totally convinced, then Andrei was ready for any kind of trial for this (готов на любое испытание). From the side (looking at it) one could have thought, that he was created (именно для того) as if entirely (specifically) to become her victim. From the very beginning there was established that, which determined their relationship: she was allowed (permitted everything), and he wans't forgiven a single mistake. Which is to say that a mistake could be anything: a certain intonation, a insufficiently quick or imprecise answer, (неверное движение), - anything at all. He once came to me (сияющим  видом) with an ecstatic expresion, and said that Salome finalled agreed to receive as a present a book of poetry from him, the choice of which she gave to him. But when I met him the next day he was grim, (sad, mournful, miserable) unhappy, and not talkative (taciturn). 
- What book did you buy her and how was it received? - I asked. He shrugged his shoulders, sighed and replied, that he had bought her Verlaine. She had returned the book to him, saying, that she had no need for it, and (on top of it, при этом) besides, (would he be so good as) she would prefer that he did not visit her anymore. He went away in despair, entirely clueless, as to the cause for her sudden and inexplicable temper. Everytime he called her on the phone, she, recognizing his voice, immedietly hung up the receiver. 
    - Let her go to the devil, - (Да пошли ты ее к дьяволу), - I said, when he told me about this.
    - I don't have the (means, resources, possibility, ability) emotional capability to do that, - he answered, - If you knew her better, you would understand why. 
    I felt bad for him, I asked Salome, why she was so harsh (cruel) with him.   
I wanted him to by me Heredia, - she said, - and he's a fool, and couldn't figure it out. 
I related this to him. Then he bought her a couple of books, Heredia (в  том  числе) amongst them, and left the bag for her at her hotel. A few days later he decided to call her again. He stood at the telephone, swallowing saliva from anxiety (глотая от  волнения  слюну), and waiting for an answer. She said: 
    - Why haven't you called for so long? I've missed you. 
    The first time he embraced her, she slapped him and said, that this was so low an act that she didn't expect it even from him, and that everything was over between them. After this he didn't sleep for two nights. On the evening of the third day she came to him - he had a small apartment by the (Булонского леса), in which he lived alone. She entered, looked at him with her ireful eyes and kissed him avidly (жадно). She spent all night with him, and early morning he took her home by taxi to her hotel. After this, drunk from rapture (ecstacy) he came to see me, woke me from sleep and started to yell (кричать), that I could never understand, that I cannot imagine, what it's like... I had went to bed late, and really wanted to sleep, besides, I actually didn't understand, what could have brought him to such a state. When he finally explained to me, what the deal was (в чем дело, matter was), I only said to him: 
- Well, I wish you (all) future hapiness, dear friend, - and fell back alseep. When I awoke he was no longer there, but the ashtray was filled with butts - he, by all appearances, had spent a couple hours in my room, restoring in memory everything, which had occured (the details of), and thinking about his (ослепите- льном) happiness. 
    Much later, trying to understand (imagine), what in essence, determined that ridiculous (abusrd) way of living (life), by which Salome lived and to which, when she could, she compelled others, I came to the conclusion, that it was the desire to not accept what was happening, but to create that, which ought to happen. He with whom she began a conversation, who she had thought about (earlier, in the past), had to answer exactly (was expected), as she had imagined it prior (before, earlier). That, which happned, had to happen exactly as it had happened in her imagination. In all of this was some kind of absurd and incurable egocentricism: and for the actions and behaviour of a person to coincide with her (imagination, notions, ideas, expectations) ideas, they would have to cease to be themselves and become something akin to a book, which she had written. This, of course, could not be, she knew this (perfectly well) and understood (it to be so, ?), but this inevitably brought her into a fury (wrath). More so (Besides this), she determindely (doggedly, steadfastly) refused to take responsibility for her actions and for the conclusions which might be drawn from them. When Andrei, came to her on the next evening and put his hand on her shoulder, she threw it off with an abrupt motion, and told him, that she would like him never to do that again. Again he fell into despair - a state, into which he (tranfered?) often and very easily. This time around it continued for five days, than there was a repetition of - (повторилось  то,  что  было  у  него  на квартире). After a certain time he lost notion (conception) of reality entirely, did not know any thing was not sure of anything, except that, outside of Salome his life did not have any meaning. (Это было в известной степени
верно) This was true (correct) to a certain extent: without Salome his life really did not have any meaning. But with Salome as well - to which, he however (of course, nevertheless, однако) would never have agreed (assented). 
    - You are, of course, not the person, whom I really need, - she told him once. - You understand, he to whom I would give myself entirely, would foremost need to above (above, better) than me in all ways. All the time I would not to be conscious of his intellectual and physical superiority over me. His understanding of art (понимание искусства) would need to be flawless. The movements of his spirit would move me with them. It would have to be a person, who is exceptional amongst all others. You understand? And what do you offer? You have some talents (qualities), but tht's all. That's not enough for me. 
Sometime afterwards, Andrei received note, that his father, living in (Тулузе) was seriously ill. Andrei showed Salome the telegram from the doctor and said, that he must go to (Toulouse?) and came to say farewell to her. She glanced at him with her ireful eyes and asked: 
    - Do you really think, that I would leave you in such a time? (Неужели) Did you really doubt, that I would go with you? You will present me to your father as your bride. 
She actually did go to Toulouse with Andrei and spent a whole two months there, during which Andrei's faher was dying from cancer of the liver. She displayed extraordinary selflessness, didn't leave his bedsides, didn't sleep for nights - and when, after the funeral, they returned to Paris, Andrei, on but a word, was ready to do anything she should ask. I thought then that he was right, when he once told me, that Salome was capable of anything and that her actions could not be predicted. 
Once he told her, having gathered enough courage: - You consider yourself more intelligent than everyone, that you know? - No, - she said. - I don't consider myself especially intelligent. I only consider others to be stupid, at any rate - most of them (many).
    - Except for that theoretical person, which you need? 
    - Except for that person, - said Salome. - She is always of the mind (thinks), that what she does is right and that she lives, exactly as (one ought to live, as she should), - Andrei told me after this, - and to dissuade her of this (of the notion) is impossible.  
I knew something about her, which Andrei did not know. That what had happened yesterday, did not obligate her to anything today, some-kind of signficant part of spiritual life was simply atrophied in her. She had no (воспоминаний) thought for memories. Today's day, with the onset of darkness, passed into non-being, and that, which had happened during the course of it, ceased to exist. She loved music very much, although she was entirely bereft (deprived) of musical hearing (ear) and could not distinguish one melody from another. The succession of (these) sounds would bring her into a state of extraordinary spiritual (excitation, agitation). But she could not remember (commit to memory) the sounds. She forgot them, just as she forgot her own feelings, her own life and the lives of those, who was connected to her and who (sank, drifted) away into the past, of which she kept no recollection. 
    * * * 
Salome and Andrei lived together for several years. She moved away and left him multiple times, he would send her telegramms, long as letters, then she would come back, and everything would begin again. Then war was declared and Andrei was mobolized. 
    Before the German army came to occupy (occupied) Paris, Salome disppeared. Andrei was a captive in Germany. I heard from one of two mates, that Salome ended up in the south, and took an active part in guerilla activities, supposedly (будто бы) married a Jewish banker during the war-time, refused to leave France with him - and was killed during combat between Guerilla forces and units of the French police. She was buried - in an (братской могиле, ?) mass grave, somewhere not far from Montpellier. Andrei learned of this after returning from captivity.
I did not see him for around ten years. When by chance I met him in Paris, I didn't recognize him right away, he looked: aged, bold, different. He recongized me. We entered a cafe together, this was on the large boulevards. He immedietly began to talk about Salome, said, that he had searched for her grave and hadn't found it. 
    - I don't even have that solace (consolation), - he said. - How she died, whaat did she think of in those last minutes, whose name did she pronounce? 
- You fought in the war, - I said. - How can you ask these kinds of questions? You know that in such circumstances, people more often than not, don't have time to think about anything or to pronounce any names. 
    - And I was not there next to her! - That's not your fault. 
    - What I exist for now, I do not know very well. To change the subject, I asked him, what he was working on. On his face appeared(spread accross) an expression of disgust (revulsion). What's the matter? I asked. 
- I sincerely regret, that I did not die there, where she died, - she said. I live a shameful life. 
    - That doesn't seem like you.
    - Nevertheless it is so. If you only knew, what I do, you would refuse to shake my hand. 
- You were always inclined towards overstatment, - I said. - I cannot believe it. What is so shameful about your life? 
He explained to me, that during the war he had lost everything, which he had had, and now was forced (compelled, вынужден) to earn a living. He spent a long time looking for work, wrote articles about art, book reviews, but money, which he earned from this was barely enough for food. And then he was made an offer, to which he had agreed. 
    - What, do you sell Women, then? 
    - No, - he said, - even worse. Those that sell women, you understand, they are professional scum. I don't mean to justify them. But they live in their own (degenerate, corrupt, putrid, leperous) corrupt world, every minute the threat of prison, police inquiries, public scorn and so forth hang over their heads. I do work no less vile than they, but with the difference, that nothing threatens me.
    - And what is it that you do, after all? (в конце концов)
    He winced in disgust against and said: 
- I wrote lyrics (words) for songs and verse for musicals. You understand? Remember our University years, Mallarme, Valeria, Rilke. And after that... 
    - Besides this do you write anything? For yourself? 
    - I tried, he said, I cannot. - I am so satured (submurged) in this musical poshlost* (derangement, vulgarity) and the idiocy, that I feel like I am chronically poisoned. 
Then he looked at me with despair and said: - Can you imagine, what Salome would have said, if she were alive? Of course, that was something he thought often about, what Salome would have said. 
But for his current life, besides the added years and unremitting memories of Salome, was characteristic that, which before was one of his main charecteristics: he lived not how he would have liked, and he did nothing, in order to change his life ( way of living). In essence, nothing forced him to invariably engage in the occupation (craft, profession), which he considered shameful. But to make the effort, which was neccesary, in order to rid himself of it, he could not. 

 X  X   X
 
To him, in all, nothing remained: not those vague (dim) hopes on some-kind of future in art, which were once in his youth, neither that meaning in life, which Salome appeard to him as. And of course, for a person with his esthetic views, that which he was forced to occupy himself with, was the lowest possible level of decline. It was difficult to hope, that now, at his age, he would suddenly begin another life, in this he was prevented, in part, by his memories for Salome: no other woman could ever take her place. And so since, years and years had passed since that day on which they parted, and his memories of her remained the same as they were in the very beginning, it seemed obvious that nothing could be changed at this point. I learned sometime later, that he had written a whole book abouyt her. Not one publisher accepted it, because Salome was drawn in such a false and naively romantic way, that it made the entire book about her entirely unconvincing. 
Of course, I thought about Salome as well. What was left of her? Our memories of her and the story of her tragic death, which at one time was recounted in the papers, but now was wforgotten, as almost everything, which had occured in the years of war. And yet, thinking about Salome, one could theoretically assume that only death stopped her on that path, which was destined and which, maybe, would have been brilliant. And of course, had she been alive, Andrei's life would have been different as well (сложилась бы иначе). 
A year after our meeting with him travelling through Italy, I stayed for sometime in Florence. I lived on the Via del Proconsulo, in a small boarding house with an owner whom I would share long talks with in the evening. He was an elderly Italian, and spoke to me in a language, which he sincerely considered to be French, but which in reality was (представлял) a result of his personal creative efforts and was equilly distant both from Italian and from French, reminiscient of one and the other (both) at the sametime. He told me about his neighbors - the owner of the book store, the owner of the cafe, his tenants, and the residents of Florence in general; he talked about the fate of Italy and even about art, which, in his opinion, ceased to exist, in the firt half of the 17th century. He spoke once about the war, which had forced many Florentines to leave their native city, which in other circumstances they would never have left, to risk their lives in strange countries, in cold Russia, in hot Africa, in France. Amongst this he told me (related to me) the story of the shoemaker, who lived not far from his boarding-house and was a former tenant, the shoemaker was born and raised in Florence, the thought of leaving his street and his city never even entered his mind. An excellent shoemaker and a good man. And then, during war time, he was mobolized and ended up in the section of the Italian army which had occupied the south of France. After Italy's defeat he joined somekind of French guerilla unit where he was heavily wounded. Only several years later when the wa rhad ended, he finally returned to Florenece. From France, by the way, he had brought with him a french girl, that was also unnecessary, there are enough italian girls in Florence. But he married his French girl and returned to shoemaking, which he never should have left. His wife helps (assists) him. She is older than him, and didn't know a thing about shoemaking at first, but now she has learned to do good work. 
    And what did she do in France? 
    
- She was, probably, a poor lonely woman, - he said. - She was fortunate, she found a man with  good trade, he doesn't do too badly, last year they even went to the sea during the summer. And, look, at how the fate of these people was contrived. He could have never left here, and she would have (доживала) continued her lonely life in France. He would have lacked her, and she would have lacked him. But since Mussoluni joined the war, because he considered himself to be somekind of Italian Napoleon, our shoemaker ended up in France and she came to Florence, a city she might not even have known about before.
Probably, I was significantly less inclined towards philosophizing, than the owner of my boarding-house because the story of the Florentine shoemaker did not particularly impress me (make an impression). Any detail in the sculptures of Michelengelo, in the bronze of Donatello or Beneveniento Chellini seemed to me infinetly more important in the history of humanity, then this or that war, the death of one dictator or another or the fate of their compatriots, including the florentine shoemaker and his wife. I was thinking then of other things, and in particular, that, everytime, that I was able to escape, the life which I lived, and which was surrounded (limited everywhere) by insignificant, in essence, ideas and conceptions, and returned to the contemplation of the paintings of (Тинторечто) or Botticelli or the statues of Michelangelo, I (fell into, went into) a state of ecstatic (frantic) and tragic rapture (ecstasy), compared to which everything else seemed entirely (completely) unimportant. 
One evening I was walking through the city, without a particular purpose, thinking about this - and then remembered one of the conversations, I had had with Andrei many years ago. We were walking then down the Boulevard ( Я. St.  Michil), it was a clear september night. Several days earlier he had returned from Venice, where he had been for the first time, and told me about his impressions. From everything he had seen, he had best remembered then (тогда) - Donatello's John the Baptist and Tintoretto's Ascencion. 
- A tall (нищий) beggar in the bronze folds of his rags, whom it is impossible to forget, - he said. - And "Вознесение". You understand: countless (numerous) angels wings, flying upwards, and in the middle of this (неудержимого  движения  Христос), ascending to the heavens. What kind of (monstorous) genius one must have, to create such a thing. Afterwards it seems, that to live, the way one has done until now, is no longer tolerable. 
- I always feel (it always seems to me), that to live as we do, is intolerable, - I said. Maybe what you say in Venice, only highlights (underlines) this, makes these notions more prominent, if you will, but if you make the effort overyourself to remember what you thought before your trip to Italy, you will find, that you knew this before as well (it). 
- Yes, but not in the same way, - he said, - and not that. What, really kills me (что  меня  убивает), you know, is the simaltenous and parralel existence of such different words and this unbearable multitude (нестерпимое разнообразие ощущений) of sensations, which no force (power) of imagination can connect (?) into a whole. Everyone of us (ведет несколько  существований) leads several existences, and that huge distance which seperates them, for me is incomprehensible and frightening. I cannot find myself with then there. 
He stopped and lowered his head - and from the side the impression was (it appeared), that at night on the boulevard a person is standing, and attentively looking (scrutunizing) his feet. Then he lifted his feet and said: 
- I cannot understand, (how) that a person, who watches the flood of a symphony, afterwards, as it rises and expands, suddenly and miracolously cntracts and returns to two notes, from which it was born, - I am thinking not of Beethoven's fifth symphony - this person, who during the course (duration) of long minutes lives in this word and into who (permenently, etnerally, forever) enetered this extraordinary movement of sounds-  how can such a person (man) after this, on leaving the concert hall, painlessly return to that, which had been until then. 
- I don't see an irreconcilable contradiction in this, - I said.
- I am not talking about contradiction, I am not comparing the (realizations, accomplishments, постижение) of art with either human emotions, - he said. - But I am frightened by the distance which seperates into different (distinct, divides into sperate worlds) that space in which I had lost myself, one time long ago and in which I can no longer find myself. 
- Maybe, genius, in part, posses the capacity of simaltenous realization (insight) in all of these seperate (different) worlds - that capacity (ability), of which mere mortals are deprived. Not a (creation, insight) into a theoretical concept, into which with equal right would enter all the human (feelings) emotions with their improbable multiplicity (diversity), - but something else - a primordial (elemental, стихийного) and flawless insight (постижения) into the whole. 
- It maybe, - he said. - But in that case it should be said that (the) (comprehension, understanding) (of) genius is beyond comprehension (reach, impossible inaccesible to us) to us. Not its but manifestation but its nature. 
I was walking now ( now walked) down a long and narrow Florentine street. It was late night with motionless air and a starry sky. A quarter century ago, in Paris, when we conversed with Andrei, the same unanswerable questions occupied my attention. If someone had told me then, that we would live twenty-five more years, through a devestating war, bear witness to the deaths of millions (of people) - and after all this would still return to the same questions, I would not have believed them. I would have said, that this cannot be, that us awaits a slow (gradual) and natural spiritual rigormosis (numbness), through which we will slowly approach death, everything will slowly loose meaning - and the feelings of other people, and works of arts, and the nature of genius. But it turned out otherwise. Everyone of us was given a particular (special, особенный) world, the laws of which did not change with time. (Wherefore, because of this) In Florence I thought about the same things, about which I thought about in Paris - with the same fruitless and hopeless persistence. (And because of this, поэтому) Andrei lived such a life, feeling revulsion at what he did, and thinking about what Salome would have said. 
    X   X   X
Once during the day I was walking first down via Ghibellina, and then I turned onto a narow street, running at a right-angle to it. Very poor people lived here, occupied with the collection of scrap metal. The first, who I saw, was a swarthy (dark) boy of around fifteen, who with an a expression of naive truimph carried in his hands several rusted springs from somekind of ruined couch. Through the thin entrances into homes sometimes could be seen yards, clutrred with rusted metal of the most diverse (varied) origins. Reaching the middle of the street, I saw the workshop of that very same shoemaker, who the owner of my boarding-house had told me about. He was a wide-shouldered man with dark (?) skin: in scant lighting - the street was dark - his unmoving face appeard to me as a bronze cast. Across from him sat his wife, that very same woman, whom he had brought from France. When I stopped by his window, she raised her head and looked at me - and I had to make an effort overmyself, - to not cry out in surprise (amazement). I met the familiar and unchanged gaze of those ireful gray eyes and recognized Salome. 
I turned around and quickly went back to my boarding-house. There I called the housemaid and asked her to take a note down to the shoemaker's wife. In that note I asked Salome to come on the next evening, at seven o'clock, to the station, where I would await her. 
When after the war I was told that she had been killed, I experienced a feeling of deep grief. But that was nothing in comparison to the cold despair, which engulfed me (siezed) that evening, while I waited for her at the station. By the table at which I sat past tourists, Germans, Englishmen, Americans, Frenchmen, their words reached me, which I heard, without ounderstanding their meaning. I saw the face of Andrei before me - not the bald man, who now wrote lyrics for songs and and felt disgusted with himself and towards his clients, but Andrei of twenty-fivers years ago, with his distant and exalted (ecstatic, rhapsodic, восторженными) eyes, and heard his words: - No, you cannot understand, you'll never understand. No, this was too cruel. If Salome had been alive...
I thought that she would not come. But she came. When she came near to my table I stood up and moved a chair (out) for her, she looked at me intently (пристально) - as if she were afraid of something. I did not know such an expression to her eyes. Swallowing from anxiety, I asked her: 
- How could all of this had happened? And without answering my question, she asked: 
- Is he alive? 
- He is. He thinks - as I did, up until yesterday, - that you were killed. Although now he very little resembles whom he was, before the war, as you do not resemble (are unlike) who you were. 
- Do you find I have changed much? No, in external appearance she had changed less, than one could expect. Her face had grown heavier, wrinkles had appeared (emerged) above the mouth, but she was still fine. 
- I did not mean external differences (difference of appearance). But you haven't answered me, how did all of this happen? I repeat, we were all sure, you had been killed in the south of France during the war. 
- I was very heavily wounded, - said Salome. - I thought that I would die, I didn't doubit. (Then, what happened next) From then it was an ordinary (сусальная  история) fairy tale, you know the kind they write in stupid sentimental books: a young italian found me, carried me to the hospital, and than came to visit me everyday. A week later the doctor told me that I would live. 
    She took out and lit a cigarrete. I remembered, that before she didn't smoke. 
- Do you remember, what it was like during the war? For many people, including myself, everything complicated disappeared (vanished). Only the simplest (most ordinary) things remained: hunger, danger, fear ofy death, cold, pain, weariness and the unconscious understanding (comprehension), that everything in life is simple (ordinary) and terrible. And all that one can wish for, is warmth, sleep, food, safety, a roof over one's head - what else? 
- Yes, yes, I undertand, - I said. - But the stone age comes to an end. 
- When we came to Florence afterwards, - she said, - the war was over, there was no more danger. Small childeren were playing in the streets, the sun was shining, it was warm. But everything that was before, ceased to exist. Have you not noticed (failed to), that that world, which existed before the war, no longer exists? 
-One could say that even if the war had never occured (happened). Of course that world no longer exists. But the one which has replaced it, did not inevitable have to be limited by the shoemaker's window on a narrow street, emerging onto via Ghibellina, and that of which your life now consists (is made up, что представляет теперь  твоя  жизнь). Was it worth living such a life, to pass through such trials and surive - so that everything would end like this? It seems to me, that you deserve better. 
- Are you sure (certain), that that which you are thinking of, is better? - No, - I said. Maybe, it is from a defecient (limited, недостаток воображения) of imagination, but still it seems to me, one cannot cripple (maim) their existence more, than you have done. I remember, that in former times you dreamed (wished) of something different. 
- And maybe, hapiness is in that, we are able to limit ourselves and understand (comprehend) that what's primary (most important) - is a few simple things? 
- Tens of millions of people live that way. But there are others, for whom it is not enough. 
I looked into her eyes and suddenly was astonished (amazed, surprised) to see that in them was to be found (they displayed) a calm (relaxed) and indifferent expression, along with that light hue (tint) of superiority, which I had known earlier, only now it seemed out-of-place and inexplicable. The despair from earlier engulfed me, I thought, that it couldn't be left like this. I said: 
- I propose the following. We will leave here. My car is around the corner. I will stop for a few minutes at the boarding-house and pay. Do you have somekind of identification? Tomorow we will be on the French border. Tomorow evening you will be in Paris, and a week later you will have forgotten everything that preceded your return. 
    - No, - she said. - You will leave Florence and return to Paris without me. 
- You categorically refuse to come? - What will I do - in a strange (alien) far away city? 
Only in the first minute of conversation with her I had heard a (disturbance, excitement, agitation, волнение) in her voice, it was when she had asked if Andrei was alive. The rest of the time she was unperturbed (calm, unmoved) a state entirely unlike her formerly (that would have been entirely unusual, unlike her former self, a constenance). 
- You forget about time, my friend, -  she said, rising. - That which you live in, is the play of shadows. From he whom you were before, the most important aspect is missing, and you obstinately refuse to accept that. You want to turn back time - even God cannot do that. If I listened to you and left with you for Paris, I would lose that which I have now and would be left in an emptiness which cannot be filled with any rememberance. Walk me home. Because now I have a home, you know? I did not have one before, I did not know the meaning of that word (that concept). 
We left the station. I walked for sometime without speaking. Then I said, repeating her words: 
- "I would loose that which I have". In other words the company of a person who does not understand one tenth, of what you understand? 
- When I saw you in the window, it shocked me, - she said. - And I knew that you would not understand what I would tell you. Maybe you will understand later. But for that you would have to imagine a completely different world, from the one you know and in which I live. 
- That's some kind of literature (fiction). 
    - No, literature  (fiction) is over for me, - she said. Literature - is your domain. And until you don't seperate yourself from it, you won't understand, what you need (what's important). 
We walked together to the corner of via Ghibellina. 
- Do you remember (recall)? - I asked. - Rue ve Vagirard, rue Monsier le Prince, rue de Tournon, rue de Buci, boulevard St. Germain, rue de Saints Peres?
- Yes, I'm remembering (вспоминаю, remember), - she said. But those that lived there in those times, no longer exist. Goodbye. 
She walked a few steps, than came back and said: 
- I didn't give you a proper farewell. She pressed her strange lips to mine for a second and went away. I watched her passing away (смотрел ей вслед) - she had preserved her straight and supple (arcing) step, for which she had been called Salome. Then I returned to the station. From there I rode to my boarding-house and lay half the night, without falling asleep, persistently (following watch упорно следя) after what she called the movement of shadows, - outside of which she now lived, and I could not imagine my existence. 
When I returned to Paris, I kept remembering the conversation with Salame. Everything, that she said, could not explain, that irreversible transformation which had happened to her. That which I had considered her shortcoming, that absence (deficiency) of recollection (memory), had now saved her: if she understand that, which was before, she could not live like that. Her transformation, it seemed to me, had happened, because she had seen death in front of her (stood before death). Reached it and than experienced the animal (natural) joy of returning to life. And the only circumstances which she did not forget, were precisely those, from when she understood (comprehended, realized) this return to life, for which she was obliged to a young italian. The last face, which she had seen before her(self), when she thought that she was about to die was his face. And the first, which she saw with different eyes, when she sensed that she would live, was his face. That was the strongest and only remembrance, that determined her transformation and her current life. The instinct towards self-preservation had closed before her all that was prior (that she formly had known), and that is why my appearance at the shopfront shocked her, as she said. That which I proposed to her - to return to Paris, - of course, was impossible, because there was no room for that city in which she once had lived in her current life. And I thought of Andrei, to whom of course, I couldn't tell about Salome; he would have thought that it was a result of a tragic misunderstanding or betrayal. But it was not a misunderstanding or a betrayal. It was death. Not of Salome, who now lived on a small street, emerging onto via Ghibellina, but of that world, a part of which she had been for us, which genuinly no longer existed, but without the spectral remembrance of which we could not conceive of our own existences. 
It was winter when I met Andrei in a small cafe on the corner of rue le Buci and Bouleard St. Germain, when I came in to drink a coffee. He was as downcast (doleful, sad) as always, and now I felt especially bad for him, because I so distinctly remembered that september night in Florence, when I had parted with Salome. With talked of various things, and then he again returned the conversation to that which had been before the war, and again began to speak, inevitably - about Salome and said: 
- You might consider it sentimentalism, but I would at least like to know, where her grave is. You know that I searched for it and couldn't find it. 
- Probably, because, - I said - you did not have the right information and searched for it in the wrong places.
