Requiem. (Панихида). Gaito Gazdanov.

Those were the cruel and sad times when Paris was occupied by the Germans. The war was overtaking more and more space. Hundreds of thousands of people moved along the frozen roads of Russia, battles were being fought in Africa, bombs were exploding over Europe. Come evening Paris plunged into an icy darkness, streetlights did not glow anywhere and windows were not lit. Only on rare winter nights, the moon would illuminate this frozen, almost spectral city as if it had been created by someone's monstrous imagination and forgotten in the apocalyptic nether of time. In the many storied buildings, which had long ago ceased to be heated, an icy dampness prevailed. In the evenings evenings, the glass boards of radio sets lit up in the tightly covered windows of apartments and a voice pierced through the cracks of static: "Ici Londres. Voici notre bulletin d'information..."*
People were shabbily dressed, the streets were mostly vacant, automobile traffic had ceased long ago, carriages drove along the city bridled with horses, and this also enhanced the impression of the tragic and unbelievable nature of what was happening, in which the entire country existed over the course of several years.
In those times I came once to a small cafe, on the outskirts of Paris, where I had a meeting with a chance acquaintance. It was an evening, during the cruel winter of forty-two. The cafe was filled with people. By the bar stand stood well dressed people - scarves, fur collars, ironed suits, - drank cognac, coffee with rum and liquor, eating sandwiches with ham, which I had not seen for a long time. I learned later, the explanation for the ham, the cognac, and everything else: the regulars of the cafe that I had visited by chance, were Russians, dealing on the black market. Before the war, during times of peace and plenty, most of these people were jobless, - not because they did not find work, but because they did not want to work from some kind of incomprehensible and stubborn refusal to live, as everyone around them did: shifts at the factory, a room in a shoddy hotel and wages once every two weeks. These people lived in the state of chronic and most frequently unconscious rebellion against the European reality, which surrounded them. Many of them spent nights in wooden barracks, nailed together from boards, gloomy and darkening on the weedy vacant grounds of the Parisian outskirts. They knew all the doss-houses of Paris, scanty yellow lights over metal bed frames of large dormitories, the damp coolness of these gloomy spaces, the constant sour stench which accompanied them. They knew the salvation army, the dens and the poor man's cafe at Maubert, where the collectors of cigarette butts gathered, torpid sleep on the benches of underground metro stations and endless rambling through Parisian streets. Many of them had wandered and trekked the French provinces - - Leon, Nice, Marseilles, Toulouse, Lille.
And afterwards, when the German army had occupied more than half of the French country, remarkable changes happened in these peoples lives. They were presented with a sudden and wondrous opportunity to get rich - without significant, and essentially almost without, work. The Germany army and the organization associated with it purchased in bulk, and without bargaining, all goods, which they were offered: boots and tooth brushes, soap and nails, gold and coal, clothes and axes, electrical wires and machinery, cement and silk - everything. These people became the middlemen between the German buyers and the French business men, selling their products. And as if in an Arabian fairy-tale, yesterday's jobless became rich.
They were living now in warm apartments, whose previous owners had left them, leaving paintings of strange subjects, good carpets and comfortable arm-chairs. On their arms they wore gold watches with gold bracelets, on their fingers they wore rings with real precious stones. Each of them had had a difficult life in the past - cities, roads and streets in various countries, huge distances, which they had covered on foot, - and now they had finally reached, that which they never dreamed of.
At first I made acquaintance with one of them, Grigori Timofeivich, a skinny no-longer young man with deep seated eyes and a sharp chin. I met him at my friend's, a former singer who had performed in the cabaret and in cafes back in his day. Though those times, when I had known him were now all past. He was gravely ill with consumption and rarely rose from his bed. Everytime that I visited him, he would take down a huge guitar from the wall with thinned-out arms, which sounded like a grand piano and sang in his deep voice, which in some miraculous way had not beed affected by his sickness, all kinds of romances and songs - and I would be amazed at the wealth of his reptoire. Gregori Timofeevich had known him from childhood, both of them were native to some small city south of Oryol. No one except myself, ever called Grigori Timofeevich by his name and patronymic, he was always Grisha; or Grishka. In contrast, no one ever called the singer by name but everyone called him Vasiliy Ivanovich.
    -So, Vasiliy Ivanovich, I bought, you know, a painting - Grisha was saying one time. - By the way I brought you some fried duck.
- Thanks, - said Vasiliy Ivanovich. - So what is this painting that you bought Grisha?
    - The painting, Vasiliy Ivanovich, is no simple thing. The amount I paid for it - it's scary to mention. But the scene is very magnificent.
- What's pictured on it?
    - A great Eagle, is pictured on it, Vasiliy Ivanovich, and it is flying somewhere, and on it's back, you know, there's a young man, that it seems to be carrying away. It doesn't quite make sense, I know, but the Eagle, I'll tell you, there's never been a better one. I've looked at this painting many a time - and everytime I see the same thing: a magnficent painting, nothing else to say.
- And who is the artist?
    - That I don't know, - said Grisha, - someone very famous. The seller told me the last name, but I forgot. Only I remembered that he said, that in comparison to him, Repin, he said, is just like a hunk of wood. And he told me the name of the painting as well, but I, you know, didn't even hear him, that's how wonderstruck I was.
    I saw this painting later in Grisha's apartment: it was a copy of Ruben's "Abduction of Ganymede".
Paintings, it should be said, were bought by all or almost by all regulars of that cafe, just as they bought gold ornaments or coins. For in these people, who had never had anything, a sudden impetuous and disordered greed had awakened, never, however, taking on the western form of mechanical accumulation of money. They spent even more, they spent without any sense and aimlessly, with some kind of peculiar ridiculousness. I remember one of them, a tall and cheerless man with a black beard, called Spiridon Ivanovich. He was standing outside the cafe and drinking cognac. At this time down the street came a glazier, shouting with a ringing voice:
    - Vitrier! Vitrier!
    - I can't stand these shouts, - said Spiridon Ivanovich. - I really can't, the nerves aren't what they one were. And this useless shouting, come, who needs him?
    The shout came again from the street:
    - Vitrier! Vitrier!
    Spiridon Ivanovich ran out of the cafe, went over to the glazier and told him in Russian:
    - Jesus christ, be quiet! How much does all of your junk cost?
    Then realizing is mistake, he repeated his question in broken French. The surprised glazier after some hesitation, answered. Spiridon Ivanovich took out his wallet, paid the cost of his entire merchandise, waited until the glazier had left and returned to his place at the bar to finish his cognac, which had a specially fine gurgle to it as it poured into his throat, accompanied by the movement of his sharp Adam's apple.
-- All day it's drudgery, - mumbled Spiridon Ivanovich, - start in the morning, something wasn't shipped, somewhere else they didn't have product, and then it's this, (еще  душу человек надрывает). The only rest one can get is in the evening. You come home, light up the heat, lie down in bed. You lie and think: you've made it, Spiridon Ivanovich, made it, finally. It's time for us lads to rest, not to quarrel with a glazier but to rest.
    - You'll rest plenty in the next world, Spiridon Ivanovich, said Volodya, an athletic man of around forty, a specialist in gold. - I do presume there shouldn't be any glaziers there, why would there be glass? Just clouds and angels, nothing more.
    - And no gold either, - said one of those present.
- Well that remains to be seen, - said Volodya. - One time I was in the Cathedral de Notre Dame, they have a charity-box hanging there. I look, and there it says on it: "for the souls, of those in purgatory". Which means that some kinds of funds can be transferred to purgatory.
    - That's their catholic business, - said Grigori Timofeevich. - The money of course, goes to the church so that they will pray here, for those who they think must be in purgatory. But you're right there, the way they wrote it is strange, for sure.
For some reason I especially remembered this day, when Spiridon Ivanovich was giving his monolog - the rasping sound of his voice, the movement of his Adam's apple on his long and thin neck and those words - time for us lads, to rest, - I remembered the expression of his drunk and tired eyes, the winter twilight and the various smells of alcohol in the cafe.
    And when Grigori Timofeevich left, Volodya told me:
    - That was poor of me, to speak of the other world, would have been better to not say anything. I'm worried for Grisha, we all feel for him. He's a good man, only he won't make it, he's had consumption for a long time.
Then Volodya began to speak of his affairs. His conversation, as always, was overfilled with technical terms, percents, alloys, carrots, one or another method of cutting jewels. It was clear, that hardly could he, in this short time that had passed since the day that the Germans occupied Paris, have mastered all of these things. When I asked him once, where it is the he knows all these things from, he answered, that he was always interested in everything related to gold and jewelry. Before the war, he as all his other friends in the cafe, were most often jobless and not infrequently homeless. He had spent whole hours in front of the show cases of jewelry stores on the rue de la Paix, read some technical books with a dictionary , knew, at what temperatures this or that metal would melt, what areas of industry make use of platinum, - and this ragged and in those times almost a beggar of a man, might have been an expert in jewelry. But before the war his interest in all of this carried a strictly selfless character, and he never imagined to himself, that there would come a day, when all of that showcased and unattainable gold would suddenly be within his grasp. According to him, only once had he met a suitable interlocutor, that knew everything as well as he himself did: it was a Hollander, with a feather-white beard and blue eyes, a well-known breaker of strong-box safes, with whom Volodya sat a couple of hours in the common cell of the Central Paris jail, where he had ended up for homelessness, - that is for the crime - of not having any money, or a permanent address.
Looking at Volodya, I quite often returned to thinking about, to what extent so called class distinctions can be arbitrary: this homeless man should on all accounts have been an owner of a large jewelry store somewhere on the rue du Faubourg St.Honore.
The other regulars of the cafe, friends of Volodya and Grigori Timofeevich, were without such strong traces of individuality. They all drank a lot, spent money, without counting, most of them had wives or lovers, of a very particular type - resembling the retouched photographs from the covers of woman's magazines, blondes in fur coats, bought through a connection from some desperate Jew, who had already sent his family on to a safe place and now, risking his life, was selling everything, that had remained from his fur clothing store. The regulars of the cafe spent their entire day in waiting for another load of goods and in telephone conversations, in the evenings they played cards, winning and loosing huge sums.
Grigori Timofeevich told me:
I live well now, of course. But now I see, that before I wished for the wrong things. Take, for example, one night I spent in Lyon, it was winter. No money, no work, no room. I spent the night at a construction site, at least it had a roof, at least the rain didn't fall through. It was cold, nothing to cover myself with. I lay there then, you know, on the boards and couldn't fall asleep, couldn't get warm - and I wished. There, I thought, an apartment that would be the thing for you Grigori Timofeevich, with damned central heating, and a bed with bed sheets. And in the evening your wife serving you food: sausage, appetizers, beefsteak. That would be the life.
    His eyes became thoughtful.
    - And it turns out, that it was all wrong. That's it's not the matter at all. Or rather, not only in that. In what - I don't know, only I know, that it's not in that. After all now I have all of that: I have an apartment and lunch and a wife, and even a bath - and it should be the life, and I don't want it. It turns out it's all not what it seems. Or so I think now. Take a person who gets into a trouble, well, for example, poverty. He, this fool, thinks that it's the most important thing. That were there no poverty, everything would be great. Alright. Take him and like in a fairy tale, dress him, shoe him, gave him an apartment and everything else and say - well now live, be happy. And where is one supposed to get it? This happiness? In the bath? Here on my hand I have a gold watch "Longines", I bought it from Volodya. I paid as much for it, as in former times I wouldn't have used in a year. So I look at the arrows - what do they tell me? It's quite clear what: for you, Grigori Timofeevich, we count the time. It was five, and now it's six. That means, you have one hour less left to live.
    And he really glanced at his watch.
- Seven o'clock? Another hour less. But I'm not scared of it. Only I regeret one thing: I've lived so many years and still don't understand, what is human hapiness? So you've warmed yourself up, ate, had a drink - good. And what than?
    It so happened, that I did not visit the cafe for around two weeks. When I next came it was an evening in late February. Grigori Timofeevich was not there, and when I asked about him, they told me, that he was sick and lying in bed. I went to see him, he lived not far from there.
He lay in his bed, thinned out and unshaved, his eyes were feverish and sad. Over his bed, under a lighted chandelier, the wings of Ruben's eagle shimmered with a blue light. I asked him, how he felt, he answered, badly.
    - The blanket already feels heavy, he said, - that's the last straw. It's the end for me. I'll die - and still I won't know, what I needed in life.
He died in the night, three days after my visit. Volodya told me:
    - Grigori Timofeevich passed away. Tomorrow, will be the funeral service and a requiem. Will you come? The requeim will be at Grigori Timofeevich's apartment, four o'clock in the afternoon.
Volodya never called Grigori Timofeevich anything other than Grisha or Grishka, I wasn't even sure, whether he had known his patronymic. And now there was an impression, that there once lived a Grisha but there died a different person, Grigori Timofeevich. On the next day, when I arrived, I saw that the entire apartment of Grigori Timofeevich was cluttered with wreaths. Where Volodya had acquired the flowers, in February of forty-three, in a starving Paris, and how much they had cost, I could not imagine. All the regulars of the cafe, the friends of Grigori Timofeevich, were already there, all of them had those metamorphized and completely unrecognizable expressions that people have in such circumstances.
    - We are waiting for the priest, - Volodya said quietly. The priest, an old man with a voice raspy from a cold, arived in a quarter of an hour. He wore a shabby cassock and his demeanor was sad and tired. He entered, crossed himself, and his lips soundlessly pronounced some kind of phrase. In the casket, covered in flowers, lay the body of Grigori Timofeevich, dressed in a black suit and his dead eyes appeared as if they were looking into that same sky, into which the Eagle ascended carrying away Ganymede.
- From whereabouts is the deceased? - asked the priest.
Volodya answered - such and such county, Orlovskya region.
    - A neighbor, then, - said the holyfather. - I am from those parts myself, it wouldn't even be thirty verst* distant. What a misfortune, I didn't even know, I would have to lay to rest a fellow countryman. How was he called?
    -Grigori.
The priest was silent for a time. It was clear, that this detail - that the deceased was from the same place as himsef, had made a significant impression. I even imagined, that he maybe thought, so it has come turn for our own now. Then the priest let out a sigh, crossed himself again and said:
    - Were these different times, I would serve a real requiem, as they do in our monasteries. Only my voice is hoarse, it's too difficult for me alone, so help me God, at least to give a short requiem here. Maybe, someone here amongst you will sing the chorus?
I glanced at Volodya. The expression of his face was such, as I never could have imagined it - both tragic and solemn.
    - Serve, holy-father, as you do in the monastery, - he said, - and we will back you, don't worry.
He turned around towards his companions, lifted both hands into the air and with a commanding and (it seemed to me) familiar gesture, - the priest looked at him with surprise - and the requiem began.
Never and no where, not before, and not after have I ever heard such a chorus. Shortly thereafter, the entire stairway of the house, in which Grigori Timofeevich lived, was full of people that had come to listen to the chorus. The raspy and melancholy voice of the priest was answered by the chorus, which was directed by Volodya.

    "Воистину суета всяческая, житие же сень и соние, ибо всуе мятется всяк
    земнородный, яко же  рече  Писание:  егда  мир  приобрящем,  тогда  во  гроб
    вселимся, иде же вкупе цари и нищие".

    "In truth all is vanity, life is but shadow and dreams, for all those on earth
    are lost, as the scripture says: Even those that gain the world, still go to the grave,
    where the beggar will be no different from the king."

    And then again the merciless reminder:

    "Таков живот наш есть: цвет и дым и роса утренняя воистину: придите ибо
    узрим на гробех ясно, где доброта телесная; где юность;  где  суть  очеса  и
    зрак плотский; вся увядоша яко трава, вся потребишася".

    "Thus our life is: in truth as flowers and as smoke and as morning dew. Go to the graves and see in truth, where the
    goodness of the body has gone, where youth has gone. Where are the eyes and countenance? Everything withers as the grass,
    everything dies."

    When I closed my eyes it began to seem to me, that the chorus was a singular might voice, rising and falling, and that it's vocal movements filled all the space around me. My eyes fell onto the casket and at that moment the chorus sang:

    "Плачу и рыдаю, егда помышляю смерть и вижу во гробе лежащую, по образу
    Божию созданную нашу красоту - безобразну, бесславну, не имеющую вида".
    "Cry and weep, for having thought of death and seen in the grave one lying,
    what was once our beauty made in the image of God - abominable, shameless, horrifying to the eyes."

Never before had a requiem seemed to me so tremendous, as on this gloomy winter day in Paris. Never before had I felt with such shocking force, that in nothing else, maybe, had human genius reached such terrific perfection as in the harmony of scorching and triumphal words in the movement of sounds, in which they occurred. Never before had I understood with such penetrating hopelessness the unstoppable approach of death to all of those, whom I loved and knew and to whom the same prayer rose, which the chorus now sang:
    "Со святыми упокой..."
    "With God put to rest..."
