On the twenty sixth of August, of last year, I opened the morning paper and read the following, that le Bois de Boulogne, not far from the big lake, a corpse of a russian man, Pavlov, had been found. In his wallet there were one-hundred and fifty francs; also in it lay a note, addressed to his brother:
    "Dear Fedya, life here is hard and uninteresting. I wish you all the best. I wrote to mother, that I have left for Australia."
I knew knew Pavlov very well and knew also, that exactly on the twenty fifth of August he would shoot himself: this was a person (man) who never told a boast or a lie. 
Around the tenth of that very same month I came to him for money: I needed to take a loan for one-hundred and fifty francs. 
    - When will you be able to pay them back? 
    - Around the twentieth, or or the twenty-fifth. 
    - The twenty fourth then. 
    - Alright. Why exactly the twenty-fourth? 
    - Because, on the twenty-fifth it will be too late. On the twenty-fifth of August I'm going to shoot myself. 
    - Is there some trouble? - I asked. 
I would not have been so laconic ( succinct), if I had not known (did not already known), that Pavlov never changes his mind (decisions) and that to try and dissuade him - would be a waste of time. 
- No, no troubles especially. But I live, as you (well) know, quite poorly, I don't see this changing in the future and I find, that all of it is very uninteristing. I do not see any meaning in continuing as I do now, eating and working. 
    - But you have family...
- Family? - he said. - Yes, I do. They won't be too disappointed; that is to say, of course, for sometime it will be unpleasant, but in essence (essentially), none of them need me. 
    - Well, alright, - I said, - and yet I still think that you are incorrect. We will speak later of this if you would like, of course, quite objectively. Are you at home in the evenings? 
- Yes, as always. Come by. However, I think I know, what you want to say to me. 
    - We will see aboutt hat. 
- Alright, good bye, - he said, opening the door and smiling, with his regular (обидной is this slighting or vexed, hurt,) and cold smile. 
    After this conversation I knew for sure, that Pavlov would shoot himself: I was as certain of it, as I was that on leaving Pavlov's I was walking on the pavement. Nonetheless, if someone else had told me about Pavlov's decision, I would have found it unbelievable (impossible, entirely improbable). I remembered right then (on the spot, suddenly), already two years ago, one of our common friends had told me: 
- You will see, he will end badly. There is nothing holy left to him. He will jump under a bus or a train. You'll see...
    - My friend, you are imagining things (fantasizing), - I had replied. 
Of all those that I knew (whom I knew, all the people I knew), Pavlvo was the most remarkable person in many respects; and, of course, the most physically robust. His body did not know fatigue; after eleven hours of work he would go out, and it seemed, never felt tired. He could (eat) live on only bread for whole months, and never feel any weakness. He knew how to work, like no one else, and also knew how to save money. He could live for several days without sleep; and (in general) as a rule he slept only five hours. One time I met him in the street it was thirty minutes to four in the morning; he was walking down the boulevard, with an unhurried pace, with his hands in (thrust into) the pockets of a light mackintosh, - and it was winter; and he; it seemed; was (completely, entirely) insenstive to cold. I knew, that he worked at a factory, and that to the first shift call (call, ring, siren, гудка) there were only four hours left (to go). 
    - You're out late, - I said, - you have work soon. 
    - I sitll have four hours to go. What do you think of Saint-Simon? He was, I think, an interesting man. 
    - Why suddenly Saint-Simon?
- I am takin my exams in the political history of France, - he said, - and in it (there), as you know figures (involves) Saint-Simon. I was studying from evening until now, and decided to go for a walk. 
    - Do you not work today than? 
    - No, why do you ask, I do. Good night. 
    - Good night. 
And he continued his slow walk down the boulevard. Yet his physical qualities appeared insubstantial and insignificant in comparison with his inner strength (will, force), uselessly wasting away. He himself could not, perhaps have determined, a way to use his remarkable qualities; and they remained without application (use).  He could I think, have been an irreplaceable captain of a ship, but under that indispensable condition, that the ship should constantly suffer catastrophes; he could have been a splendid (excellent) traveler through a city, undergoing an earthquake, or through a country, in the grips (grasp) of plague (epidemic), or through a burning forest. But none of this was the case - no plague, no forest, no ship; and Pavlov lived in wretched parisian hotel, and worked, like everyone else. I thought at one time, that maybe, his very own strength, looking for a way out or to apply itself, had impelled (inspired, propelled, inducsed) him to (towards) suicide; he exploded like a corcked flask from the terrible internal preassure. Yet everytime I tried to understand the cause (reason for) his voluntary death, I had to reject it (that argument, logic), since not one of the many principles, which determine the actions (behaviour) of a person in the most diverse circumstances, applied to Pavlov; and in consequence (as a result) Pavlov was inevitablly (неизменно оказывался) outside of the whole system of reasoning and assumption; he was on the other side, and did not resemble anyone else. 
He had a distinctive smile, which at first made one uncomfortable: the smile conveyed a superiority, especially one could sense - that almost everyone felt this, even the stupidest of people, - that Pavlov has some kind of right to smile this way. 
He never told lies; that was completely amazing. More than that, he never flattered anyone, and in reality, told everyone, what he thought about them; and all of this was quite heavy (akward) and discomforting, and the more clever (witty) people tried to turn it into a joke and laugh; and he would laugh with them - with his pecuiliar (kind of) cold laugh (ter). And only once, in the entire time (duration) of our friendship I heard in his voice a momentary softness (tenderness), of which I had considered him incapable. We were talking about theft. 
    - Ah, it's a curious thing, - he said. - You know, I was once a thief; but than I decided it wasn't worth it, stopped stealing and don't steal at all anymore. 
    - You were a thief? - I was surprised.
    - What's strange about that? Most people are thieves. If they don't steal, it's only on account of fear or chance (fortune, accident). But in his soul, almost every person is a thief. 
- I have heard this very often (I have frequently happened to hear this); I perhaps, would be willing to agree (assent), that this is one of the most widespread errors (superstituions, opinions). I do not think that every person is a thief. 
- But I do. I have a special sense for theives. I can tell right away, if a person is capable of theft or not. 
    - Me, for example? 
    -You are, - he said. - You won't steal one hundred francs. But you could for a woman or if there was the temptation of big money - as well. 
    - And Leva? - I asked. I had gone to school with Pavlov (за границей); we had many companions (Friends) in common - one of them was Leva - a cheerful, light-heared and in all a pretty good person.
    - He'll steal. 
    - And Vasliyev? 
    He was one of the best (finest) students - a morose and (almost sickly) painfully conscientious person, slovenly dressed, very diligent and boring. 
    - And he too, - without wavering said Pavlov. 
    - How? He's virtuous, hard-working and prays to God everyday. 
    - He is, above all things (chiefly, mainly), a coward, and everything that you mentioned, is of no matter (import, signficiance).  He's a thief - and a petty thief besides. 
    - and Sereja? 
    Sereja was our comrade (companion, friend), an idler (lazy), a dreamer and a diletant - but he was vey capable; he liked to lie for hours on the grass, and to think about things that would never come to pass, to dream about Paris - we lived in Turkey, - about the sea and God knows about what else; and everything real, which surrounded him, was to him strange and he was indifferent to it. One time (on one occasion), just before one of the important exams, I woke up at night and saw that Sereja was awake and smoking.
    - What are you, - I asked, - worried? 
    - Yes, a little, - he said uncertainly, - It's nohing at all. - Well not entirely. - Are you worried you might fail? - What are you about? He asked with surprise. - About the exam, of course. - Oh, no that's not interesting. I was thinking about something else entirely. - What about? - I'm thinking: a steam-powered yacht costs to much money, and a  
sail based one isn't worth making. And I won't have money for a steam-powered one, - he said with conviction; meanwhile didn't even have money to buy cigarretes. He smoked - and tossed the cigarrete butt; it was dark, and it seemed to me, that the cigarrete but fell onto the blanket. -  Sereja, - I said in a minute, - I am under the impression that you're cigarrete butt fell on the blanket. - And what of it? - He answered, - wait and and we'll see if it burns. But more often they burn out (die out): the tabocco is moist (raw, not dry). - And he fell asleep, and probably, saw a yacht in his dreams.
    -And Sereja? - I repeated.
And for the first time Pavlov's face took on what for him was an unusual, soft (tender, kind) expression, and he smiled in a completely different way, than he always did - with a wonderful transparent smile. 
    - No, Sereja would never steal, - he said. - Never.
I was one of the few people he conversed with; I was drawn to him by a constant curiosity; and speaking with him, I forgot about the need - which I felt almost always (которую обычно не переставал чувствовать) - in some way to distinguish myself, - to say something, which I thought succesful, or to express some kind of opinion (point of view), that was distinct from everyone else's; I forgot about this disgusting (awful) habit of mine, and I was only interested in what Pavlov was saying. It was perhaps the only time in my life, where my interest towards (in) a person was not dictated by selfish motives, - that is by my desire to express myself in yet another combination of words. I could not say, that I loved Pavlov, he was too much of a stranger to me, - and he also never loved me, the same as the others. We both knew this very well. I knew, besides, that Pavlov had no compassion (empathy) for me, and if I was in a spot (trouble, off badly); and if I considered the possibility for such empathy to exist, I would have immedtietly rejected it.
    I remembered, how once Pavlov told me about an acquintance of his, who asked him for money, giving him his word, that he would (return) pay it back tomorow, - and did not come by for two weeks; then arrived at night in tears asking for forgiveness - and for at least five more francs, since he had nothing to eat. 
    - What did you do? - I asked. 
    - I gave him money. I would not have given them to another person (man); but he's not a man, and I told him that. And he remained silent, and waited, for me to get the money from my pocket. 
    He smiled and added:
    - I gave him ten francs, by the way. 
    He had no compassion in his soul, for him compassion was strictly logical; it seems to me, that this can be explained by the fact that he himself, never had any need for someone (anyone) else's compassion (empathy). His comrades (companions) did not love him (had no loe for him); and only the simplest of people were (с ним хороши) good with him; they did not understand him and considered him a bit weird (abit of a freak), but, altogether, an excellent person. Maybe this was, true in the general (common) meaning of the word; but only not in the way that they thought. At any rate, Pavlov was fairly generous; and the money, which he earned, spending ten-eleven hours at the factory, he spent easily and without hesitation (simply). He gave quite a bit of money away, numerous people owed him money; and it was not rare for him to help strangers, that approached him in the street. One time, we were walking with him down the deserted Arago Boulevard - it was dark, quite late at night and cold, in all the houses the shutters were tightly closed, the leafless trees especially, it seemed to me, pronounced (highlighted, strengthened) the sensation of emptiness and cold, - and we were approached by a ragged, thicket (stocky, stumpy) man, who said hoarsely, that he had only gotten out of the hospital yesterday evening, that he is a worker, and he's left out in the streets for the winter; and couldn't we help him with something? - - Voila mes papiers {Here are my papers (фр.).}, 0 he said, known that no one would look at them. Pavlov took the papers, moved under the streetlight and showmed me them; there was no hospital mentioned there. 
    - You see, how he lies, - he said in Russian.
    And, turning back to the beggar, he laughed and gave him a five-franc note. 
    Another time, we met a lame russian man, who was also asking for money. I already knew him. When at one time - this was not long after my arrival in Paris, I came out on a summer day from the library and (was) walking down the street reeding, when I suddenly felt, how someone thrust a cold, dry hand over my book, and I, lifting my eyes, saw before me a man in a decent gray suit, with a good hat, and lame. Lifting (tipping,) his hat with an offshod movement, he said (spoke) with unnatural speed: 
    - Are you Russian? Very glad to meet you, due to my disability, whoich as you can see, and being deprived of the ability, which is common to others, to earn money through hard emigrant labor and exlie, I am compelled (forced) to turn to you, as a former officer of the volunteer army (добровольческой армии )* andg a student of the last course of the Historico-philological (историко-филологического   факультета Московского императорского университета) department of the Imperial Moscow university, as a former hussar, as a sworn political enemy of the communist government with a request for you to give me a moment's attention, and putting yourself in my position, (оказать мне  посильную поддержку) to help me as far as you are able. 
He pronounced all of this, without break, and I never remembered (would have) his long and incoherent appeal, especially as I had not understood half of it, - if subsequently I had not had to listen to it several times over - and almost without change; only sometimes he was a student not at the Moscow, but at the Kazanski or Haskovski university, and not a hussar, but a uhlan (уланом?) or an artilleryman, or a (former) liutenant  of the blacksea fleet. This was a strange man; I saw him by chance, in the evening, in the garden by the church of Sen-Jermen de Pre (Сен-Жермен де Пре) - he sat next to an (пожилой и грустной женщиной) old and distressed women, bent over with his head lowered, and he had such an miserable look, that I began to feel sorry for him. But three days later in the cafe on the (площади Одэон) Odoen square, this same man was smoking a cigar, drinking somekind of violet liquid, in a particularly tall glass while hugging a (раскрашенную) prostitute with his right hand. 
    That day, when he had first approachd me, I had a total of six francs and I told him: 
    - Unfortunately, I cannot help you, I don't have money. I can give you two francs; to give more would have been difficult. 
    - Three fifty, please, - he said. I was surprised: 
    - Why exactly three fifty? 
    - Because, young man, - he answered almost didacticly (наставительно, condescending), - three fifty - is the price of lunch in a Russian buffet. - And, taking on again his virtuous air, added: - I thank you, comrade. - And was off, limping a bit and leaning on his cane. 
    And exactly he (came to) appealed to Pavlov and myself. 
    - Are you russian? Very glad to meet you, on account of my disability (handicap)...
    - I already know this, - said Pavlov. - I am aware, that you studied at the Moscow and the Kazanski university, have been a hussar, an uhlan (уланом), an artilleryman and a sailor. And did you not also sail on a submarine, as well as, study at a seminary? 
    - Do you not know him? - He asked me. - I have already given him money five times. 
    - I know, - I said. - I think regarding the historico-philological department he was getting carried away. But in all he's an unfortunate (несчастный) person. 
    - Next time, apply (approach) yourself to someone else, - said Pavlov. - All said (in sum, in total) I have paid you fifty francs: I think, that you are not worth that money. Do you think, that I tell you this, because I am taking advantage of your bad (poor) circumstances: if in your place was some-kind of biship, I would tell him the same. Here is the money.
Pavlov lived in a very small room in one of the cheap hotels of (Монпарнаса) Monparnasa. He had painted the walls himself, nailed up bookshelves, placed books, bought himself an oil-stove; and when he was able to save a certain sum of money, allowing him not to work for some time, he would spend whole months in the room, alone from morning to evening, only going outside to buy bread, or sausage, or cheese. 
    - What do you do all tha time? -I had asked him during one of those periods. 
    - I think, he answerd. 
    I never gave (attributed) much signficance (thought, weight) to those words; but later I found out, that Pavlov, that unshakeable (inflexible) and infallible person (man), was in essence (essentially) a dreamer. This seemed extremely (extraordinarily) strange and least of all like him - and yet, so it was (it was so). I suppose, that aside from myself, no one suspected it, because no one had tried to question Pavlov, regarding what he thought about, (the thought did not enter anyones mind) no one thought if it, especially because Pavlov himself was (uncommonly) exceptionally lacking in curiousity; he exprimented only on himself. 
    He had lived in Paris for four years, working morning to evening, almost without reading and without taking particular interest in anything. Then suddenly he decided to get a higher education. This happened because, someone in a conversation with him, had accented that they had completed a University. 
        - So what, university is good for God knows what (университет это не Бог весть что) ,- said Pavlov.
        - You, on the other hand, did not finish one. (and still, but still)
        - Yes, but that's just a matter of circumstance (chance, accident). Although, you've given me a thought: I'll finish a University (degree). 
        And he began to learn: entered the philosophical (отделение) of the historico-philological department and studied in the evenings after work - which would have been nearly too much for anyone else. Pavlov himself knew that very well. He told me: 
- So they are writing about some Russians, that work at night at the station, and go to university during the day (учатся). These kinds of things remind me of sketches (articles) by war correspondents; I remember, I read somewhere in a newspaper about preperations for battle, and it was said there, that the "cannon stood with it's trunk poised menacingly at the foe". For any military man, even not an artilleryman (let alone a), it's clear, that this correspondent did not know anything about cannons and probably had never even see them. Same thing here (it's): they will tell some reporter, and he reports it - (дескать), they work at night, and attend classes during the day (study, unviersity, учатся). Well why don't they send one of those reporters (such a reporter) for night labor (on nightshifts, night time work), he won't even be able to write his own column (хроники), let alone occupy himself with serious things. 
    
    
    Serving in the white army, I was an frightful coward; I was very afraid for my life. 
To me this seemed improbable, so I asked one of the (comrades in arms, men who had served with) Pavlov about his cowardice, who I happened to know. 
    - Pavlov - he said. - Altogether the bravest man, that I have ever seen.
I told Pavlov about this. 
    - I didn't tell you, - he replied, - that I shirked from danger. I was very afraid - nothing more. Which doesn't mean that I hid. I attacked with one other comrade a machine gun battery and captured two machine guns, although my horse was killed out from under me. I scouted - and altogether (вообще) how is it possible to do otherwise? But none of this prevented me from being very cowardly. But only I knew about this, and when I told others, they didn't believe me. 
    - By the way, how are your studies? 
    - In two years I will finish the University (complete my degree).
    I was the witness at the occasion, when two years (as some two years later) he was conversing with the same (that same) companion of his, with whom he had talked for the first time about higher education. They talked about various subjects and at the end of their conversation the (собеседник) asked Pavlov: 
    - And, what of, a university education, do you continue to think that it is a matter of circumstance and trivial (a trifle, of no import, nonsense)? 
    - More than ever. 
    He shrugged his shoulders and switched to a different subject. He did not say, that during this time he had completed a degree with the historico-philological department of Sorbonne. 
His manner of speaking always left a strange impression: never in everything, that he said, had I ever noticed even the slightest desire to make on effort to say something kind or give a compliment or at the least to keep silent about something unpleasant; this is why most people avoided him. One time, in the company of several (a number) of people, he happened to remark in passing, that he had little money. Among us was one Svistonov, a young man, always well dressed and somewhat boastful: he had a lot of money, and he would often say, accomponying his words with a disdainful (slighting) gesure: 
    - I don't understand, gentlemen, you don't know how to live. I don't ask anyone for a loan, I live better than all of you and never feel abased. I can imagine what a person must feel, when he has to ask to borrow money. 
And this same Svistonov, knowing that Pavlov was exceptionally  careful, and that there was no risk involved, offered him his support, said that he would, with pleasure, give Pavlov any sum he would ask for. 
    - No, answered Pavlov, - I won't take money from you. 
    - Why? 
    - Because you are very petty (stingy, niggard, a miser), - And more than that, I don't take well to your complaisance. After all I hadn't asked you for anything. 
    Svistonov turned pale and became silent. 
    Pavlov did not know and did not love women. At the factory, where he worked, one of his co-workers was a french woman, around thirty-two years of age, who had become widowed not too long ago ( не так давно овдовевшая). She took a very strong liking to him: first of all, he was an excellent worker, secondly, he was physically attractive to her: sometimes, she would spend a long time staring at the brisk (quick) and steady movements of his hands, bared up to their elbows, at his pinkish nape and wide back. She was only a simple laborer and considered Pavlov to be like wise: he almost never spoke with his coworkers at the  (мастерской) plant, and she ascribed it to shyness, to the fact, that he was a foreigner, and other circumstances, not at all related to the real reasons which induced (prompted) Pavlov to keep silent. Many times she had tried to start a conversation with him, but he gave (curt replies) one word answers (answered in a single word). 
    -Il est timide, - she would say. 
    Finally she was succesful. He spoke in french in a somewhat bookish (literary) language - not onc edid he use a single word "argo" (?). It was a strange conversation: and it was difficult to imagine more varied people, than this factory woman and Pavlov. 
    - Listen, she said, - you are a young man and I think you're not married. 
    - Yes. 
    - How do you manage without a wife? - she asked. If they had something in common, they both spoke what they meant (consisted in that they called things by their real name) (spoke without pretenses incinuitations, spoke straightly) (называли вещи  своими  именами). Only they spoke and thought according to different notions (Ideas); and I think, that the distance seperating them, was perhaps, the largest, that could seperate a man and a woman. 
    - You must need a wife or a lover (Вам необходима), - she continued - Ecoute, mon vieux, - and she switched to "tu", - we could get together (settle together, get hitched). I could teach you many things, I see, that you are inexperienced. And further - you don't have a woman. What do you say? 
He was looking at her and smiling. No matter how insensitive she was, she could not fail to see, by his smile, that she had made a most callous mistake, in addressing this person. She almost had no hope left, for a positive outcome to the conversation. And yet - (already in the moment, by inertia) - she asked:
    - Well, what do you say? 
    - I don't need you, - he answered. 
    Another charecteristic ran strongly in him, an exceptionally rare one: a (singular freshness) (novelty) particular uniqueness of his perception, an independence of thought - and complete freedom from those prejudices, which he could have acquired in his environment. He was un declasse, as many others: he was not a laborer, not a student, not a military man, not a peasant and noot a noble - he had spent his whole life outside of any so called (сословных ограничений) class boundaries: all people of all classes were strangers to him. But the most surprising of it, was that though he was not gifted with great intelligence, he was able to preserve his indepedence completely (во всем), and when it came to those (fields), where the influence of authority was especially strong - in literature, in science, in art. His opinions regarding these things were always unlike anything or almost anything, that I might have had read or heard. 
    - What do you think of Dostoevksy, Pavlov? - asked him a young poet, with an interest (who was intersted, involved) in philosophy, tragic russian literature and Nietsczche. 
    - He was a (мерзавец) bastard, in my opinion, - said Pavlov. 
    - How? What do you say? 
    - A bastard, he repeated. - A hysterical person, who considered himself a genius, petty, like a woman, a lier and a gambler (на чужой счет) with other people's money. If he was even a slight more comely, he would have (поступил бы на содержание к старой купчихе) been a (lover, gigalo) for an old merchant's widow. 
    - But his literature ? 
    - I'm not intersted in that, said Pavlov, - I've never finished a single one of his novels. You asked me what I think about Dostoevsky. In every person there is some one special charecteristic, that is most substantial (essential) to them, and everything else - is just, extra. For Dostoevsky, it is (essentially, maily) charecteristic that he is a bastard. 
    - You are saying monstorous things. 
    - I think, that monstorous things, don't exist at all, - said Pavlov.
I came to visit him on the fifteenth, we drank tea and then began to talk about suicide. 
    - You have ten days left, - I began. 
- Yes, approximately. Well, what kind of considerations (reasons) are you going to suggest to prove the (, irratinality) inexpediancy of such an act? You can say anything you want: you know, that it won't change anything. 
    - Yes, I know. But I would like to hear your basis for it again.
    - They are extremely simple, - he said. - Consider for yourself: I work at a factory, I love quite poorly (badly). It's impossible to think of any changes to this: I thought of making one trip, but now it seems to me, that if it happened to disappoint my hopes, for me that would be the biggest blow of all. Furthermore: my life does not matter for anyone else. My mother has had time to forget me, I died for her ten years ago. My sister is married and we don't write. My brother, whom you know, (оболтус) is a twenty-five year old (dunce, do-nothing), he'll make out with me. I don't believe in god; there isn't a single woman that I love. Life is boring: to work and eat? I'm not interested in politics, or art, or the future of Russia, or love: it's just boring. I will never have a career - not that a career would inspire me. Tell me, please, after all this: what is the point of my living? Maybe if I was also under the delusion that I have some kind of talent. But I know that I don't have any talents. That's all.
He (sat) was sitting across from me and smiling, with a condescending expression as if he were saying: you see, how simple all of these things are and yet I understood them, and you don't and never will understand. I could not say, that I felt bad for Pavlov, as I would feel bad for a mate (comrade, friend), from whose hands maybe I would pull the revolver. Pavlov was somewhere outside of empathy: as if he was surrounded by an aura, through which the emotions of other people could not penetrate, no more then they could penetrate through an opaque screen; he was too distant and too cold. But I did regret, that sometime from now, such a precious and dear (дорогой), so irreplaceable a human mechanism, would (should) cease to move and depart from life (the living); and all of his qualities - tireslessness (indefatigability), bravery, and fearsome spiritual strength (strength of will) - all of this will dissolve into the air and die, without ever having found itself any kind of an application.  
    - Now, tell me what you think, about such an occasion (event), - saiv Pavlov. 
    - I think, - I replied, - that you are wrong, and when you are looking for some kind of logical justification for everything: this is, indeed, a waste of time. Since such abstract ideas could impel (induce, you) to any kind of act, or rather, I consider the question to be contingent. Consider for example, that I am working fourteen hours a day, dog-tired (устаю как собака) and so hungry as if I hadn't eaten for three days. Then I go to a restaurant, eat a full meal, come home, lie down on the couch and smoke a cigarrete. Why the hell do I need meaning (purpose) for? 
    He shrugged his shoulders .
    - Or consider, I continued, - That you had lived a whole year without a woman: I wouldn't tell you this, but after all we don't have that much time left to talk, - so I won't bother to try and find a better example. So you lived a year without a woman - and then you finally obtain the affections of a young woman, who becomes your lover. Can it be that in this you would also be looking for some kind of meaning? 
    - Well, those are all temporary things, he said. 
    I was surprised, that the physical love towards life was not strong in this person. If he were a sickly youth, it would be understandable. But he was exceptionally strong and tough; and such considerations would perhaps, have accounted for, that he did not tire so much from fourteen hours of work, - but it could not explain other things. Nothing resembling, either desperation, or disillusionment was characteristic (to be found in) to Pavlov. I had known this man for many years, known him better, than others, and could could only think as a result that before me had appeared and passed a mysterious phenomenon, to identify which it turned out I had neither the thoughts, nor the words, nor even an intuitive (comprehension, understanding). I could perhaps rest at that, telling myself, that Pavlov with his suicide, was as enigmatic to me as hoes creatures, which live on the sea floor, which are completely similar to plants (?), like a noise in the night of an unknown origin, as countless other non-human events. But I could not reconile myself to that. 
- Is there anything in the world, that you love? - I asked. I expected a negative answer. But Pavlov said: 
    - There is. 
    - What is it than? 
    And suddenly he began to talk (speak). I remember, how strange his confession appeared to me that evening. He spoke, without (restraint, timidity, shyness), (приводя) mentioning terrible details, which in other times would have (покоробили) me: but at that time everything seemed natural to me - not for a single minute could I forget, that Pavlov is sentenced to death and that there is no force which could save him: and his voice, which had then sounded and wavered, would vanish without an echo, would die away in that body, which would become a corpse. He began (from a far) at a tangent and told me a childhood story, long years of thieving, an extraordinary hunt after a badget with a revolver, in Russia, in Vladimerskaya region (губернии), - a river, a boat, which he road; he seemed to be clearly (взволнованным, agited, disturbed, uneasy, restless), when he spoke of swans, he called them the most beautiful birds in the world. "Do you know; he said following, - that in Australia there are black swans? At (known, designated, certain, известное) particular times of the year, over the inner lakes of the country, they appear in tens of thousands". And he spok of the sky, shrouded in dark mighty wings, - it's some kind of different (other, seperate) history of the world, it's a possiblity of a different (perception) understanding of, everything that exists, - he said, - and I will never see this. 
    - Black swans! - he repeated. - When mating season comes, the swans begin to cry. Crying is hard for them; and in order, to produce the clearest and stronger sound, the swan puts its neck fully extended onto the water, and the lifts its head and cries. On the inner lakes of Australia! These words are better than music to my ears. 
He spoke for a long time after, about Australia and black swans. He knew numerous details about their lives; he had read everything, that was written about them, spending whole days translating English or German texts, with a dictionary and a notebook in hand. Australia was the (one) sole illusion of this man (person). In her were entwined (connected, combined, joined) all of the desires, which he had ever had, all of his hopes and dreams. It seemed to me, that if he were to put all the force of his feelings (emotions) into a single gaze (glance) and to bring his eyes to bear on that island, the water would bgin to boil around it; I imagined in my mind this fantastic picture, which one might see in a dream: a thousand black swan wings, covering the sky, and the cold desolote wind on a deserted shore, around which the sea boils and breaks (plays, волнуется). 
I sat with him almost until morning - and left, tormeneted by a strange feeling. - Be well, - told me Pavlov. - Good night. I have to be at the factory in an hour. 
    - What's the point of that now? - I asked him without thinking (против воли).
- Money, money. I can't take them with me of course, but I have to pay a couple people. It's not fair to take advantage of one's position. 
    I keep silent. 
    - Essentially (in essence, basically), I'm leaving for Australia, he said.
