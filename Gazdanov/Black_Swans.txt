On the twenty sixth of August, of last year, I opened the morning paper to read the following, that in the le Bois de Boulogne not far from the big lake, the corpse of a Russian man, Pavlov, had been found. In his wallet there were one-hundred and fifty francs; also in it lay a note addressed to his brother:
    "Dear Fedya, life here is hard and uninteresting. I wish you all the best. I wrote to mother that I have left for Australia."
I knew Pavlov very well and knew also, that exactly on the twenty fifth of August he was going to shoot himself: this was a person who never told a boast or a lie.
Around the tenth of that very same month I had come to him for money: I had needed a loan for one-hundred and fifty francs.
    - When will you be able to pay them back?
    - Around the twentieth, or on the twenty-fifth.
    - The twenty fourth then.
    - Alright. Why exactly the twenty-fourth?
    - Because, on the twenty-fifth it will be too late. On the twenty-fifth of August I'm going to shoot myself.
    - Is there some trouble? - I asked.
I would not have been so laconic had I not already known, that Pavlov never changes his mind and that to try and dissuade him - is a waste of time.
- No, no troubles especially. But I live, as you well know, quite poorly, I don't see this changing in the future and I finds that all of it is very uninteresting. I do not see any meaning in continuing as I do now, eating and working.
    - But you have family...
- Family? - he said. - Yes, I do. They won't be too disappointed; that is to say, of course, for sometime it will be unpleasant but essentially none of them need me.
    - Well, alright, - I said, - and yet I still think that you are incorrect. We will speak later of this if you would like, of course, quite objectively. Are you at home in the evenings?
- Yes, as always. Come by. However, I think I know what you will say to me.
    - We will see about that.
- Alright, good bye, - he said, opening the door and smiling, with his regular cold and vexing smile.
    After that conversation I knew for sure, that Pavlov would shoot himself: I was as certain of it as I was that after leaving Pavlov's I was walking on pavement. Nonetheless, if someone else had told me about Pavlov's decision, I would have found it entirely unbelievable. I remembered right then, how two years ago one of our mutual friends had already told me:
- You will see, he will end badly. There is nothing holy left to him. He will jump under a bus or a train. You'll see...
    - My friend, you are fantasizing, - I had replied.
Of all those that I knew, Pavlov was the most remarkable person in many respects and, of course, the most robust physically. His body did not know fatigue; after eleven hours of work he would go out and it seemed without any trace of weariness. He could live on only bread for whole months and never feel any weakness. He knew how to work like no one else and also knew how to save money. He could live for several days without sleep; and even on regular days he slept only five hours. One time I met him in the street it was thirty minutes to four in the morning; he was walking down the boulevard, in an unhurried pace, with his hands in the pockets of a light mackintosh, - it was winter, and it seemed he was completely insensitive to the cold. I knew, that he worked at a factory and that there were only four hours left to the first shift.
    - You're out late, - I said, - you have work soon.
    - I still have four hours to go. What do you think of Saint-Simon? He was, I think, an interesting man.
    - Why suddenly Saint-Simon?
- I am taking my exams in the political history of France, - he said, - and in it, as you know figures Saint-Simon. I have been studying since till now since evening and decided to go for a walk.
    - Do you not work today than?
    - No, why do you ask, I do. Good night.
    - Good night.
And he continued his slow walk down the boulevard. Yet his physical qualities appeared insubstantial and insignificant in comparison with his inner (spiritual) strength, which was uselessly idling away. He himself perhaps could not have determined a way to use his remarkable qualities; and they remained without application.  He could I think, have been the irreplaceable captain of a ship but only under that indispensable condition that the ship should constantly suffer catastrophes; he would have been an excellent traveler through a city, undergoing an earthquake, or through a country in the grips of a plague, or through a burning forest. But none of this was the case - no plague, no forest, no ship; Pavlov lived in wretched Parisian hotel and worked like everyone else. I thought at one time, that maybe his very own strength, seeking a way out or an application for itself, had induced him towards suicide; to explode as a corked flask from the terrible internal pressure. Yet every time I tried to understand the reasons for his voluntary death, I had to reject this line of argument, since not one of the many principles which could be used to determine the actions of a person in the most diverse circumstances could be applied to Pavlov, and consequentially Pavlov was inevitably outside of that whole system of reasoning and assumption; he was on the other side and did not resemble anyone else.
He had a distinctive smile, which at first made one uncomfortable: the smile conveyed a superiority, especially one could sense, and almost everyone felt this (even the dullest of people), - that Pavlov has some kind of right to smile this way.
He never told lies; that was completely amazing. More than that, he never flattered anyone and in practice told everyone exactly what he thought of them; all of this was quite heavy and discomforting, the more clever people would try to turn it into a joke and laugh it off and he would laugh with them - with his peculiar cold laugh. Only once, in during the entire course of our friendship had I heard in his voice a momentary tenderness, of which I had considered him incapable. We were talking about theft.
    - Ah, it's a curious thing, - he said. - You know, I was once a thief but than I decided it wasn't worth it, stopped stealing and don't steal at all anymore.
    - You were a thief? - I was surprised.
    - What's strange about that? Most people are thieves. If they don't steal, it's only on account of fear or fortune. But in their soul almost every person is a thief.
- I have heard this quite frequently, and perhaps would be willing to assert that this is one of the more widespread misconceptions. I do not think that every person is a thief.
- But I do. I have a special sense for thieves. I can tell right away, if a person is capable of theft or not.
    - Me, for example?
    -You are, - he said. - You won't steal one hundred francs. But you could because of a woman or if there was the temptation of big money - as well.
    - And Leva? - I asked. I had gone to school with Pavlov overseas, we had many companions in common - one of them was Leva - a cheerful, light-hearted and over-all a pretty good person.
    - He'll steal.
    - And Vasliyev?
    He was one of the finest students - a morose and painfully conscientious person, slovenly dressed, very diligent and boring.
    - And he would, - without wavering said Pavlov.
    - How? He's virtuous, hard-working and prays to God everyday.
    - He is, above all things, a coward and everything else that you mentioned is of no matter.  He's a thief - and a petty thief besides.
    - and Sereja?
    Sereja was our friend, an idler, a dreamer and a dilettante - but he was very capable; he liked to lie for hours on the grass and to think about things that would never come to pass, to dream about Paris - when we lived in Turkey, - about the sea and God knows about what else; and everything real, which surrounded him was strange to him and he was indifferent to it. On one occasion, just before one of the important exams, I woke up at night and to see that Sereja was awake and smoking.
    - What are you, - I asked, - worried?
    - Yes, a little, - he said uncertainly, - It's nothing at all. - Well not entirely. - Are you worried you might fail? - What are you about? He asked with surprise. - About the exam, of course. - Oh, no that's not interesting. I was thinking about something else entirely. - What about? - I'm thinking: a steam-powered yacht costs to much money and a sail based one isn't worth making. And I won't have money for a steam-powered one, - he said with conviction; meanwhile he didn't even have enough money to buy cigarettes. He finished smoking and tossed the cigarette butt, it was dark and it seemed to me that the cigarette butt fell onto the blanket. -  Sereja, - I said in a minute, - I am under the impression that you're cigarette butt fell on the blanket. - And what of it? - He answered, - wait and and we'll see if it burns. But most often they burn out: the tobacco is moist. He fell asleep and probably saw a yacht in his dreams.
    -And Sereja? - I repeated.
And for the first time Pavlov's face took on what for him was an unusual, kind expression and he smiled in a completely different way than he always did - with a wonderful transparent smile.
    - No, Sereja would never steal, - he said. - Never.
I was one of the few people he conversed with. An inexhaustible curiosity drew me into this and speaking with him I would forgot about the need - which I otherwise felt almost constantly - to distinguish myself in some way - to say something, which I thought successful or to express some kind of point of view that was distinct from everyone else's; I forgot about this disgusting habit of mine and only took interest in what Pavlov was saying. It was perhaps the only time in my life, where my interest towards another person was not dictated by selfish motives, - that is by my desire to express myself in yet another combination of words. I could not say that I loved Pavlov, he was too much of a stranger to me, - and he also never loved me. We both knew this very well. Besides, I knew that Pavlov had no compassion for me and if I were ever in trouble, and  considered the possibility for such compassion to exist, I would have immediately rejected it.
    I remembered, how once Pavlov told me about an acquaintance of his, who had asked him for money giving him his word that he would pay it back on the next day, - and did not come by for two weeks; then arrived at night in tears asking for forgiveness - and for at least five more francs since he had nothing to eat.
    - What did you do? - I asked.
    - I gave him money. I would not have given it to another man but he's not a man and I told him that. And he remained silent, waiting for me to get the money from my pocket.
    He smiled and added:
    - I gave him ten francs, by the way.
    He had no compassion in his soul, for him compassion was strictly logical. It seemed to me, that this could be explained by the fact that he himself never had any need for anyone else's compassion. His companions did not love him and only the simplest of people were good with him; they did not understand him and considered him a bit weird but altogether, an excellent fellow. Which maybe was true in the common meaning of the word, only not in the way that they thought. At any rate, Pavlov was fairly generous and the money, which he earned spending ten-eleven hours at the factory, he spent easily and without hesitation. He gave quite a bit of money away, numerous people owed him money and it wasn't rare for him to help the strangers that approached him in the street. One time, we were walking with him down the deserted Arago Boulevard - it was dark, quite late at night and cold, in all the houses the shutters were tightly closed and it seemed to me that the leafless trees especially highlighted the sensation of emptiness and cold, - when we were approached by a ragged, stocky man, who said hoarsely, that he had only gotten out of the hospital yesterday evening, that he is a worker, and he's left out in the streets for the winter, and couldn't we help him with something? - - Voila mes papiers {Here are my papers (fr.)}, he said, knowing that no one would look at them. Pavlov took the papers, moved under the streetlight and show them to me: there was no hospital mentioned there.
    - You see, how he lies, - he said in Russian.
    And turning back to the beggar, he laughed and gave him a five-franc note.
    Another time, we met a lame Russian man who was also asking for money. I already knew him. One time not long after my arrival in Paris, on a summer day, I had come out of the library and was walking down the street reading, when I suddenly felt someone thrust a cold, dry hand over my book and lifted my eyes to see before me a lame man in a decent gray suit, with a good hat. He lifted his hat with an off-shod movement, he spoke with unnatural speed:
    - Are you Russian? Very glad to meet you, due to my disability, which as you can see and being deprived of the ability that is common to others, to earn money through hard emigrant labor and exile, I am compelled to turn to you, as a former officer of the Dobrovolcheskaya army[0] and a student of the last course of the Historic-philological department of the Imperial Moscow University, as a former hussar, as a sworn political enemy of the communist government with a request for you to give me a moment's attention, and putting yourself in my position, to help me as far as you are able.
He pronounced all of this, without break, and I would never have remembered this long and incoherent appeal, especially as I had not understood half of it, - if subsequently I had not had to listen to it several times over - and almost without change; only sometimes he was a student not at the Moscow but at the Kazanski or Haskovski university, and not a hussar, but a uhlan[1] or an artilleryman, or a former lieutenant of the black sea fleet. This was a strange man; I saw him by chance, in the evening, in the garden by the church of Saint-Germain-des-Pres (Сен-Жермен де Пре) - where he sat next to an old and grieving women, bent over with his head lowered and such an miserable look that I began to feel sorry for him. But three days later in the cafe on the Odoen square, this same man was smoking a cigar, drinking some kind of violet liquid in an especially tall glass, while hugging a dressed-up prostitute with his right hand.
    That day, when he had first approached me, I had a total of six francs and I told him:
    - Unfortunately, I cannot help you, I don't have money. I can give you two francs; to give more would have been difficult.
    - Three fifty, please, - he said. I was surprised:
    - Why exactly three fifty?
    - Because, young man, - he answered almost lecturing, - three fifty - is the price of lunch in a Russian buffet. - And, taking on again his virtuous air, added: - I thank you, comrade. - And was off, limping a bit and leaning on his cane.
    And exactly he appealed to Pavlov and myself.
    - Are you Russian? Very glad to meet you, on account of my disability...
    - I already know this, - said Pavlov. - I am aware, that you studied at the Moscow and the Kazanski university, have been a hussar, an uhlan, an artilleryman and a sailor. And did you not also sail on a submarine, as well as study at a seminary?
    - Do you not know him? - He asked me. - I have already given him money five times.
    - I know, - I said. - I think regarding the historical-philological department he was getting carried away. But in all he's an unfortunate person.
    - Next time, apply yourself to someone else, - said Pavlov. - All said, I have paid you a total of fifty francs: I think that you are not worth that money. Do you think that I tell you this because I am taking advantage of your poor circumstances: if in your place was some kind of bishop, I would tell him the same thing. Here is the money.
Pavlov lived in a very small room in one of the cheap hotels of Montparnasse. He had painted the walls himself, nailed up bookshelves, placed books, bought himself an oil-stove, and when he was able to save a certain sum of money, allowing him not to work for some time, he would spend whole months in the room, alone from morning to evening, only going outside to buy bread, or sausage, or cheese.
    - What do you do all that time? - I had asked him during one of those periods.
    - I think, he answered.
I never gave much weight to those words but later I found out that Pavlov, that unshakable and infallible person, was essentially a dreamer. This seemed extraordinarily strange and least of all like him - and yet it was so. I suppose that aside from myself, no one suspected it, because no one had tried to question Pavlov regarding what he thought about, it never occurred to anyone to do so, especially because Pavlov himself was exceptionally lacking in curiosity; he experimented only on himself.
Pavlov had lived in Paris for four years, working morning to evening, almost without reading and without taking particular interest in anything. Then suddenly he decided to get a higher education. This happened because someone in a conversation with him, had emphasized that they had completed a University degree.
	- So what of it, university is good for God knows what,- said Pavlov.
	- And yet you on the other hand have not finished one.
	- Yes, but that's just a circumstantial matter. Although, you've given me a thought: I'll finish a University.
And he began to study: he entered the philosophical track of the historical-philological department and studied in the evenings after work - which would have been nearly too much for anyone else. Pavlov himself knew that very well. He told me:
So they are writing about some Russians, who work at night at the station and attend their classes during the day. These kinds of things remind me of articles by war correspondents; I remember, I read somewhere in a newspaper about preparations for battle and it was written there, that the "cannon stood with its trunk[2] poised menacingly at the foe". For any military man, let alone an artilleryman, it would be absolutely clear that this correspondent does not know anything about cannons and probably has never even see them. It's the same thing here: someone will tell some reporter and he reports it, they work at night and attend classes during the day. Well, why don't they send one such reporter for a night shift, he won't even be able to write his own column afterwards, let alone occupy himself with serious things.

    Serving in the white army, I was a frightful coward; I was very afraid for my life.
To me this seemed improbable, so I asked one of Pavlov's comrades in arms, who I happened to know, about his cowardice.
    - Pavlov - he said. - Altogether the bravest man that I have ever seen.
I told Pavlov about this.
    - I didn't tell you, - he replied, - that I shirked from danger. I was very afraid - nothing more. Which doesn't mean that I hid. I attacked а machine gun battery with one other comrade and we captured two machine guns, although my horse was shot out from under me. I scouted - and altogether how is it possible to do otherwise? None of this prevented me from being very cowardly. Except only I knew about it and when I told others, they wouldn't believe me.
    - By the way, how are your studies?
    - In two years I will finish the University.
    I was the witness at the occasion, when some two years later he was conversing with that same companion of his, with whom he had first spoken of higher education. They talked about various subjects and at the end of their conversation this person asked Pavlov:
    - And, what of, a university education, do you continue to think that it is a matter of circumstance and entirely trivial?
    - More so than ever.
    He shrugged his shoulders and switched to a different subject. He did not bother say that during this time he had completed a degree with the historical-philological department of Sorbonne.
His manner of speaking always left a strange impression: never in anything that he said, had I ever noticed even the slightest desire to make on effort to say something kind or give a compliment or at the least to keep silent about something unpleasant; this is why most people avoided him. One time, in the company of several of people, he happened to remark in passing that he had little money. Among us was one Svistonov, a young man, always well dressed and somewhat boastful: he had a lot of money as he would often say, accompanying his words with a disdainful gesture:
    - I don't understand, gentlemen, you don't know how to live. I don't ask anyone for a loan, I live better than all of you and never feel abased. I can imagine what a person must feel, when he has to ask to borrow money.
And this same Svistonov, knowing that Pavlov was exceptionally careful and that there was no risk involved, offered him his support, saying that it would be his pleasure to give Pavlov any sum he asked for.
    - No, answered Pavlov, - I won't take money from you.
    - Why?
    - Because you are very petty person, - And more than that, I don't take well to your complaisance. After all I haven't asked you for anything.
    Svistonov turned pale and became silent.
Pavlov did not know and did not love women. At the factory where he worked, one of his co-workers was a french woman, around thirty-two years of age, who had become widowed not too long ago. She took a very strong liking to him: first of all, he was an excellent worker, secondly, he was physically attractive to her: sometimes, she would spend a long time staring at the quick and steady movements of his hands, bared up to their elbows, at his pinkish nape and wide back. She was only a simple laborer and considered Pavlov to be like wise: he almost never spoke with his coworkers at the plant and she ascribed it to shyness, to the fact, that he was a foreigner and to other circumstances, not at all related to the real reasons which were occasion for Pavlov's silence. Many times she had tried to start a conversation with him but he only gave one word answers in reply.
    -Il est timide, - she would say.
    Finally she was successful. He spoke French in a somewhat literary language - not once did he use a single word 'argot'. It was a strange conversation: and it was difficult to imagine more different people than this factory woman and Pavlov.
    - Listen, she said, - you are a young man and I think you're not married.
    - Yes.
    - How do you manage without a wife? - she asked. If they had something in common, it was that they both said what they really thought without pretenses. Only they spoke and thought according to different ideas; and I think, that the distance separating them was perhaps the largest, which could separate a man and a woman.
    - You must need a wife or a lover, - she continued - Ecoute, mon vieux, - and she switched to "tu", - we could get together. I could teach you many things, I see, that you are inexperienced. And further - you don't have a woman. What do you say?
He was looking at her and smiling. No matter how insensitive she was, she could not fail to see, by his smile, that she had made a most callous mistake in addressing this person. She almost had no hope left, for a positive outcome to the conversation. And yet - from inertia - she asked:
    - Well, what do you say?
    - I don't need you, - he answered.
    Another characteristic ran strongly in him, an exceptionally rare one: a particular novelty of perception, an independence of thought - and complete freedom from those prejudices, which he could have acquired in his environment. He was un-declasse, as many others: he was not a laborer, not a student, not a military man, not a peasant and not a noble - he had spent his whole life outside of any so called class boundaries: all people of all classes were strangers to him. Yet most surprising, was that though he was not gifted with great intelligence, he was able to preserve his independence in all things, and when it came to those fields where the influence of authority was especially strong - in literature, in science, in art. His opinions regarding these things were always unlike anything or almost anything, that I might have had read or heard.
    - What do you think of Dostoevsky, Pavlov? - asked him a young poet, with an interest in philosophy, tragic Russian literature and Nietzsche.
    - He was scum in my opinion, - said Pavlov.
    - How? What do you say?
    - Scum, he repeated. - A hysterical person, who considered himself a genius, petty, like a woman, a lier and a gambler with other people's money. If he was even a slight more comely, he would have been a lover-boy for an old merchant's widow.
    - But his literature ?
    - I'm not interested in that, said Pavlov, - I've never finished a single one of his novels. You asked me what I think about Dostoevsky. In every person there is some one special characteristic, which is most substantial to them and everything else - is just, extra. For Dostoevsky, the primary characteristic is that he is scum.
    - You are saying monstrous things.
    - I think, that monstrous things don't exist at all, - said Pavlov.
I came to visit him on the fifteenth, we drank tea and then began to talk about suicide.
    - You have ten days left, - I began.
- Yes, approximately. Well, what kind of considerations are you going to suggest to prove the unsoundness of such an act? You can say anything you want: you know, that it won't change anything.
    - Yes, I know. But I would like to hear your basis for it again.
    - The reasons are extremely simple, - he said. - Consider for yourself: I work at a factory, I live quite badly. It's impossible to think of any changes to this: I thought of making one trip but now it seems to me that if it happened to disappoint my hopes, for me that would be the biggest blow of all. Furthermore: my life does not matter for anyone else. My mother has had time to forget me, I died for her ten years ago. My sister is married and we don't correspond. My brother, whom you know, is a twenty-five year old do-nothing, he'll get by without me. I don't believe in god; there isn't a single woman that I love. Life is boring: to work and eat? I'm not interested in politics, or art, or the future of Russia, or love: it's just boring. I will never have a career - not that a career would inspire me. Tell me, please, after all this: what is the point of my living? Maybe if I was also under the delusion that I have some kind of talent. But I know that I don't have any talents. That's all.
He sat across from me and smiled with a condescending expression as if he were saying: you see, how simple all of these things are and yet I understood them, and you don't and will never understand. I could not say that I felt bad for Pavlov, as I would feel bad for a mate from whose hands maybe I would have pulled the revolver. Pavlov was somewhere outside of compassion: as if he was surrounded by an aura, through which the emotions of other people could not penetrate, no more then they could penetrate through an opaque screen; he was too distant and too cold. But I did regret that sometime from now, such a precious and dear, so irreplaceable a human mechanism, would cease to move and depart from life; and all of his qualities - tirelessness, bravery, and the fearsome spiritual strength - all of these would dissolve into the air and perish, without ever having found any kind of an application.
    - Now, tell me what you think about all this, - said Pavlov.
    - I think, - I replied, - that you are wrong, and when you are looking for some kind of logical justification for everything: this is, indeed, a waste of time. Since such abstract ideas could induce to any kind of act, or rather, I consider the question to be contingent. Imagine for example, that I am working fourteen hours a day, dog-tired and so hungry as if I hadn't eaten for three days. Then I go to a restaurant, eat a full meal, come home, lie down on the couch and smoke a cigarette. What the hell do I need meaning for?
    He shrugged his shoulders .
    - Or consider, I continued, - That you had lived a whole year without a woman: I wouldn't tell you this but after all we don't have that much time left to talk, - so I won't bother to try and find a better example. So you lived a year without a woman - and then you finally obtain the affections of a young woman, who becomes your lover. Can it be that in this you would also look for some kind of meaning?
    - Well, those are all temporary things, he said.
    I was surprised, that the physical love towards life was not strong in this person. If he were a sickly youth, it would have been understandable. But he was exceptionally strong and tough; such considerations could perhaps have accounted for him not tiring from fourteen hours of work, - but it could not explain other things. Nothing resembling, either desperation, or disillusionment were characteristic to Pavlov. I had known this man for many years, known him better than others, and could could only think in conclusion that before me had appeared and passed a mysterious phenomenon, to identity which it turned out I had neither the thoughts, the words, nor even an intuitive comprehension. I could perhaps rest at that, telling myself, that Pavlov with his suicide, was as enigmatic to me as those creatures, which live on the sea floor that are so much akin to plants, like a noise in the night of an unknown origin, as countless other non-human events. But I could not reconcile myself to that.
- Is there anything in the world, that you love? - I asked. I expected a negative answer. But Pavlov said:
    - There is.
    - What is it than?
    And suddenly he began to speak. I remember, how strange his confession was that evening. He spoke, without restraint, mentioning terrible details, which in other times would have shocked me: but at that time seemed entirely natural - not for a single minute could I forget, that Pavlov is sentenced to death and that there is no force which could save him: and his voice, which sounded and wavered then would vanish without an echo, would die away in that body, which would become a corpse. He began in the distant past and told me a childhood story, of long years as a thief, an extraordinary hunt after a badger with a revolver, in Russia, Vladimerskaya region, - a river, a boat, which he rode; he seemed very much incised, when he spoke of swans, he called them the most beautiful birds in the world. "Do you know; he said following, - that in Australia there are black swans? At particular times of the year, over the inner lakes of the country, they appear in tens of thousands". And he spoke of the sky, shrouded in dark mighty wings, - it's some kind of alternative history of the world, it's a possibility of a different understanding of, everything that exists, - he said, - and I will never see this.
    - Black swans! - he repeated. - When mating season comes, the swans begin to cry. Crying is hard for them and in order to produce the clearest and stronger sound, the swan puts its neck fully extended onto the water, and the lifts its head and cries. On the inner lakes of Australia! These words are better than music to my ears.
He spoke for a long time about Australia and black swans. He knew numerous details about their lives, he had read everything that was written about them, spent whole days translating English or German texts, with a dictionary and a notebook in hand. Australia was the one sole illusion of this person. In it were entwined all of the desires, which he had ever had, all of his hopes and dreams. It seemed to me, that if he were to put all the force of his emotions into a single gaze and brought his eyes to bear on that island, the water would begin to boil around it; I imagined in my mind this fantastic picture, which one might see in a dream: a thousand black swan wings, covering the sky, and the cold desolote wind on a deserted shore, around which the sea boils and breaks.
I sat with him almost until morning - and left, tormented by a strange feeling. - Be well, - told me Pavlov. - Good night. I have to be at the factory in an hour.
    - What's the point of that now? - I asked him without thinking.
- Money, money. I can't take them with me of course but I have to pay a couple people. It's not fair to take advantage of one's position.
    I kept silent.
    - Essentially, I'm leaving for Australia, he said.
I exited on to the street, it was morning and normal life was just starting; I looked at the people riding and passing by me and thought frantically, that they would never understand the most important things, and I thought that that morning, I had just heard and understood them and that if this sad truth become apparent to everyone else I would be burdened and upset.
