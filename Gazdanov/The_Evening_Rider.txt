Gaito Gazdanov. The Evening rider. 

It began with a small misunderstanding that had occured at night - it was around two o'clock, during the month of June, in Paris, about ten years ago. I was walking home from the northern part of city and on reaching the (Трокадеро) square, sat down on a city bench, to smoke a cigarette. Approaching I had seen, that someone was already on the bench and also from afar one could tell - by the lowered head and especially noticeably un-agile frame, - that this was an elderly man. So it turned out. I lowered myself on to the other end of the bench, took out and lit a cigarette. The old man mumbled something. 
- I'm sorry, - I said, - did you say something? 
And then, the old (elderly) man suddenly got angry and answered sharply (резко): 
    - I said, that even at night I can't get any peace. 
He had a round head, with scarce gray hair, ireful, black-&-white brows and a fixed weary face as if it had acquired once and for all time the accustomed expression of contained fury. 
- Excuse me, - I said, rising - I didn't mean to disturb you. - And I started to walk away. Suddenly an unexpectdely strong voice, startled me, - so improbable did it seem, that it could belong to this man, who judging from his looks was some eighty years of age, - and stopped me. 
    - Young man!.. I turned around.
    - Do you not know me? 
    - No, Monsieur. 
    - Really, you don't know me? You're not a journalist? You can give me your word that you're not a journalist?
I answered that really I was not a journalist. The old man relaxed and said tersely: you may sit down, - and I sat back down on the bench. It was a warm June night, the air was fresh and damp from the recent rain.

- You are not Frenchmen? - The old man asked with the same terse manner. 
- No, Russian. 
- То-то вас носит нелегкая в три часа ночи. (How is this said in French - let alone english? What the devil has you about at three o'clock in the night?
I said in my defense, that I was returning home. The old man nodded his head. Then, after several seconds had passed, asked me how old I was? I answered, he looked at me and then smiled widely and when I asked, what had humored him, he said: 
- The absurdity, the foolishness of it all. You know, that in every newspaper they already have obituaries ready for my death; half an hour, after I die, you can read about it in any publication. 
- And then those dim memories of which I was almost unconscious, suddenly clarified themselves: already a minute ago, apparently had known, that I had seen somewhere - something long familiar, characteristic, the round head and those gray whiskers. When I had become accustomed to the capricious light of the street lamps in the square, I examined the eyes of my interlocutor, ideally faded and having such a strange expression, which I had never noticed before - something like an astonishing mixture of grief and fury. 

I answered that this was a professional charactersitic and that I had always been disturbed by it (indignant) - as is disturbing, although completely natural, the relation to death of gravediggers and the employees of the funeral service beareau; and said that sometimes to me it had seemed so repulsive - that I could only find solace in the ironic justice of fate - that these people too would be buried with the same savage (широко улыбнулся) indifference by their very collegues. And I told the old man, how during the time of the civil war in Russia, one of my comrades (mates, friends) was dying from typhus, by his bedside (bunk), rolling a cigarrete with unsteady fingers, stood a dead-drunk medical attendant Feofan, who was occupied telling some kind of anecdote, and when I asked him, if there was any hope, ooked at me with foggy eyes and said: 
    - You're a queer man. Can't you see - he's going to meet the devil soon (кончается  к  чертям)- and you're asking. Just look at his mug, - can't you tell? 
A few months later - and on an almost identical (bunk,bed) of a medical wagon (train-car) - the medical attendant Feofan was dying with a shrapnel would in the stomach. Tears stood in his empty eyes, that had already taken on the (lead свинцовое) pre-death expression, he kept repeating: Oh my god, can it be? Oh my god, can it be? - Everything that he had once known or thought, had already died, already no longer existed for him in thos minutes; he was leaving us, and had preserved (carried away) of everything that had been just (only that one phrase): "Oh my god, can it be?" - and before this he had always thought that he didn't believe in God and wasn't afraid of death, and maybe in life he was write, but now he was mistaken in death. But the concept of a mistake already no longer existed in his conscious - it was there, on the other side, a few centimeters from his body, where I stood, and his eyes (also, too) saw my green shirt with epaulets, a wide letter belt, the dark holster of a revolver. 
The old man looked at me intently and then asked, after I had finished the tale: 
- And you think this is good? (To be a good thing) 
- No, I do not think so. 
- And what use is it that you know things, which you were not meant to know? It's the same (все та же история, ) as the tale of Lazar: people don't return from there. Or, if you'd like, - like a crushed existence: you live (maimed) crippled and unlike everyone around you. Do you (love, like) medals? 
    - Medals? - I asked surprised. - No, I had never even thought about it. 
- That's a very bad, - the old man said. - I have often (frequently) noticed that a person (man) must love (like) medals; if they don't have a value to him, - that's a very bad sign, extremely bad.  What are you doing in Paris?
    I said that I was studying, and named my professors. He laughed with an unexpected and what seemed like an uncharecterisitc (to him) good-naturedness and said that he acribes them to the category of relatively innocent fools. He promised to (describe, explain) the theory to me someitme. Some-time? - I said. - But I, maybe will never see you going. - The old man shrugged, and I became uncomfortable; I realized, that this would better have been left unsaid. He made a quick turn of his head and again said tersely, guessing my thoughts, that he was not afraid of death (had no fear) - actually not afraid, not like, medical attendant Feofan. Although, maybe, in the last minute... - Have you read Faust? - Then he interupted himself and answered: - Yes, of course you have, all the Russians read it. 
I had already become accustomed to his abrupt, constantly shifting conversation. It was getting a little cooler (crispher), the moon from time to time would be covered by clouds, in the distance above Monamarte, appeared a faint, reddish dawn. The old man rose from the bench and presented me his hand in a black cotton glove. 
- Good bye, (fare well)  - he said - I was glad to talk with you. You can't imagine what a pleasure it is, to meet a person who doesn't ask questions and doesn't plan to extract any kind of personal gain from you. 
- The assesment, is of course, flattering, (хотя и отрицательная), - I said, unwillingly smiling, - I in my turn should thank you for your attention (за внимание, time).
    - Maybe, we will meet again, - he said, - sometimes I walk at night and I live near here. And since my feet have already walked almost all of the distance, which was alloted to them by fate, I don't walk from Monartre to (в Отэй), but only as far as this square. Fare well. 
He touched his head slightly and left (went off). I stood and watching him leave (ему вслед, my gaze followed him) - (on, at) his benk back, the rather brisk motion of his almost unbending legs, which he placed toes pointing apart, almost as if he were walking on his heels. I waited, until by my calculations he should have reached home and went home; it was already five o'clock in the morning. 

-----

That I didn't recognize him right away, could be explained only the by complete (total) unexpectedness (? this is a terrible bulky word) of this meeting, its improbability. So, one time, during winter, at dawn (day-break, на рассвете), in one of the cafe's on Monparnasse, where pimps usually gather, I saw an elderly respectable man, at a table, set (filled, covered) with numerous ash-trays and four unfinished glasses of red wine; he was playing cards with a woman in black - she was sitting with her back towards me, and I could not see her face. But the man (this person, this man) seemed especially (astonishingly, very) familiar to me; and only a (few) seconds later I realized, who he was; this was a well known statesmen, a former 
(русский   министр) (Russian Minister ? this is weird), that I was accustomed to seeing
in a completely different, (председательской обстановке). And as then I recognized my interlocutor only after he had said, that in all the newspapers there were obituries had been prepared for him (for a long time, had been prepared, already were prepared). 
His biography was known to the entire world, just as his nickname was, his legendary sharpness (abruptness), his furious character; and all of this in some incomprehensible way was united with a tremendous intellect; he was called the last statesmen in Europe. His life, in reality (really was), extraordinary, he had everything that a man could wish for, - vast (enormous, gargantuan), - and (несравненная, matchless, without equal) fame (reputation, reknown) and almost limitless (boundless) power (authority), that is that which he (scorned, held in contempt) and despited in times of his early youth (?). As almost all intelligent people, he had no illusions, a vast life experience only magnified and brought (довел) to the outer limits that cold contempt for people and that invariable (animosity, fury, hostility) regarding which thousands of articles and scores of books had been written. (and) Now having removed himself from the world, he was living out the last days and weeks of his endlessly long life. I remembered his faded (misty, foggy) eyes and his gait with spread toes (spread-toed); he was near ninety years old. He was for me a long ago past historical event, a living ruin of a world that had disappeared long ago, as so incomprehensible (marvelous, strange), (unlikely, improbable) and wonderful was that he breathed the same air and lived during these same empty and (alarming, disqueiting, uneasy troubeled) days in the third decade of our current century. 
I doubted that, I would ever see him again, but from time to time in late hours of the night I would go to where I had met him for the first time, sit, smoke and wait; but his hunched figure did not appear. Around two weeks had passed - and then one night I saw him again. He was sitting on his bench with his head lowered, and raised it slowly when I came right up to him. 
    - Oh, it's you? - he said slowly as a way of greeting. - You forgot your hat again. 
    I answered that I don't wear a hat. 
- Maybe, it's less stupid, than it first seemss, - he said, - maybe, maybe. Although I doubt it, - he added with sudden merriment in his eyes. - Sit down, sit down. Why do you smoke such bad cigarrettes, no money? Yes? That's good, at your age money isn't necessary. 
    - But I would allow myself...
    - Yes, I know; you think so, that others spend it frivilously, but you would spend it wisely. A misconception. 
    - His eyes narrowed and he began to laugh. 
    - I am very glad, that you are in a good mood, - I said. 
    - Since yesterday I don't have any pains, - he answered. It doesn't mean anything, of course, in juridicial (legal) speech it's called sursis (отсрочка, fr.) - But I am getting nearer (it is approaching), young man, getting nearer... How are your studies? 
    I answered him, that I was preparing a history of economical doctrines. He shrugged his shoulders and said with pity, that one could find more interesting ways to spend ones time and it's stupid, when a person, who should eat heartily and spend days with a lover, sits in a closed space and studying rubbish that no one needs, not to mention (ever more so, all the more so, especially since) all economical doctrines are good for nothing. He considered the theory of physiocrat (?) the least stupid, as he said. He began to explain to me in quick, abrupt phrases his views on the groundlessness (несостоятельность ?) of those positions (theories), which were considerd fundamental in political economy (economics) - I was astonished by his exceptional memory. The great majority of economists he considered to be dolts (blockheads); as far as I can remember, only regarding (Тюрго) he said that he was intelligent. Adam Smith was in his opinion a chronicler (compiler), Riccardo was a speculant, Prudon - was a peasant brain (?), without capacity for (incapable of) any kind of evolution (development). Then he added and said: 
- You are sitting and thinking: (вот старик разошелся).
- No, but you dedicaed a lot of time to these questions in your own life. 
- Unfortunatly, unfortunately, - he added quickly. - But it did not give any positive results, all of it is dust (ashes) and rubbish (nonsense): human society is based on mutual theft - and there is nothing about this in a single tractatus on economics. 
    - But precisely the physiocrats did not draw sharp boundaries between thieves and businessmen. 
- And they were right, they were right. Do you know how to operate (drive) an automobile? 
That was as sudden (impuslive, unexpected), as during our first conversation, the question (when he asked), whether I (liked, loved, admired) medals. I answered, that I knew how. - That's good - the old man added shortly. 
    - Were you born in Russia? In what city?
    - In Petersburg. 
    - A remarkable country, it has some surprises in store. I won't see them, but you will. If you will live. - Then he added - I remember the last emperor, an insignificant man. On the other hand, to rule a people (nation) of one-hundered-sixty-million (? really)... - He (hesitated, thought for a minute), and then added an untranslated phrase: n'importe qui peut s'y casser le  cul  {Приблизительно: кто угодно сломает себе шею (фр.).}.
He began to speak (talk) about history, and said that it's forgery and lies: events never happened in the way they are described. 
    - But the taking of Bastille...
-Nonsense (rubbish, foolishness)... Two loons (lunatics, madmen) and three fools - that's called a historical event, what do you say? 
- It seemed to me, that not the taking of Bastille, in itself, but as a beginning (origin) of a (the well known) certain historical process, that...
    - Nonsense (Ерунда). Historical processes extraneous to (devoid of) the conceps of beggining and end, as is all of nature. It's purely circumstansial (entirely contigent), purely, purely. You understand? 
He raised his colorless, infuriated eyes towards me. 
They rob each other, they devour each other - that's (there that's) the contents of all of history. You are speaking about factors - he said, although I hadn't used the term. - The factors are essentially (substantially) deceipt and idiocy. 
    - It seemed t ome, tht...
- Maybe you have, a kind heart, and you don't want to think, that the world is organized (exactly) like so, and nother otherwise. More than that, you don't understand a thing about it. 
He pattted me on my shoulder and smiled. 
    - It's not that I consider you (dumber) more stupid than others, you see, - I don't think that. But you do not understand - as childeren do not understand (скабрезных) anecdotes. That's the entire problem (issue). 
Everything, that he said, seemed astonishing (remarkable) to me - not because, it was unlike ordinary (normal) things, but because, decidely (definitively, absolutely) all of his statements (views, opinions, everything he said) was (were)  negative. To me this seemed unbelievable; he began to seem like a villian from a cheap novel, in who (decidedly, positively; definitely, abosolutel) every vice is connected and who is devoid of even the smallest, most accidental of virtues. But at the sametime it was a living and intelligent man, his absolute negativity seemed impossible to me. I told him this. 
    - You're a savage, - he answered. - You ask questions, which it's not acceptable to ask. A European would never have allowed himself (themself) this. But I prefer this. 
His face became distorted, he shut his eyes and suddenly began to slowly slip down from bench. I caught him under his arms, sensing for a second the thin elderly forearm. His body seemed to me to be improbably (unbelievably) light. He breathed heavily for a minute, and an expression of despair stood in his eyes. Th
en he said: 
    - Help me home and without fail come here tomorow, at this same time. 
    The small distance seperating us from the house, in which he lived, we covered in twenty minutes, several times he became worse and his body began to slip; we stopped, waited for him to catch his breast, and then continued our way. The last few meters he walked more firmly. 
    - My thanks to you, - he said at the doorstep. - So, we will see each other tomrow. I will ask you for one favor, will you not turn me down? 
I was very uneasy (worried) and answered, that I am wholly at his disposal. He said farewell, stretched out his trembling hand towards me in his cotton glove. 
On the next day, on buying an evening paper, Immedietly I saw - his portrait on the very front page under a communication stating that he had suffered an (episode, attack, seizure) of (уремии). In the article it was written that in view of the advanced age of the patient, the doctors declined to make any kind of predictions. 

------

At night I came to (Трокадеро) square, although it was completely obvious that there was no point to doing so (no sense in it). I knew, that he was seriously ill, maybe near death, and, accordingly, not only could not come himself, but it was unlikely he could even remember some insignificant plan and somehow warn me. More so he did not know my address, or even my name. I spent many hours in those days, even the policemen rarely crossing the square, began to look at me with suspicion, or so it seemed to me, but without bothing me, probably, because I did not look like a bum (beggar), and after all (further, more so) there were no disturbances during this time. But I presume, that during this time in the neighborhood their had been a robbery, I likely would have had to spend some time at the commissariat and to give an explanation from my constant night time presence at (in) the square; and of course, no one would have believed my explanation. 
I would not have considered myself obligated to that wearisome (tiresome, exhausting) duty, if the old man had not asked me, if I could not do him a favor (service) some-time. The word "some-time" carried in his words almost an immediate connotation; only very little time remained to ihm; it was meassured in days, maybe, in weeks, therefore, I had to be ready at any minute. I spent a long time puzzling over what on earth he could need (require, want) from me and why he thought, that I could do this favor (service) for him. He knew nothing about me or almost nothing, had no conception of (the resources available to me, resources, means, opportunity), nor of the extent of my willingness (readiness) to help him in whatever it may be. Besides, what could he need? Despite the fact that he had distanced himself from (rule, power) long ago, his name remained magical, and it would be enough for him to give instructions (directions), for everything to be done, exactly as he would like. I did not doubt that a (grand, solemn) funeral awaited him, что давно готовы траурные каймы для некрологов and that the whole country awaited only his death, which could not, it seemed (by all appearances), not arrive (come) in the nearest future. And of what, of what kind of extraordinary (unusual) thing could a person think about in his very last, most terrible (fearsome) days? To him (it seemed to me) should not remain, regret, repentance, or the desire to correct some-kind of mistakes - to this old man - in whom the contempt towards man was really (pushed, extended, brought) to an unprecedented (unparreled, incomparable), almost inhuman strength (force). 
Three weeks passed. I knew from the papers, that there had been improvements in the state of his health, that on the eve he had for the first time risen form bed. And so, at night, I saw, as with difficulty and extremely slowly he walked in the direction of (towards) the square. I ran to meet him and took him by the arm (и взял его под руку). 
    - Thank you, thank you, - he said, abruptly as always. - If we have time we will speak later. Now I am in a hurry, I have to get there first, - he said, stopping. 
    We were passing by the bench. I wanted to seat him.
    - No, no, - he said. - Remember, I asked you for a favor? 
- I can only repeat, that I am at your disposal, - the same as I was three weeks ago. 
- You said you know how to operate an automobile. Could you drive me to Beaulieu? 
    - When? - I asked.
    - Now , - he answered. 
    - I am ready, - I said. I wanted to ask, if he was in a condition capable of bearing the long hours of the drive, but I didn't say a word. We continued to walk, arriving on one of the avenues, which surrounded the square. The old man said: The automobile is the nearest garage. I asked you to drive me, because I did not want for anyone else to know about this trip. 
I nodded my head silently. Entering the garage, we were met by the nightwatchman, an arab, the old man showed me the car, which we were supposed to take; it was a splendid "Chrysler". I opened the door, the old man got inside, leaning on his stick on on my hand, I drove the car ought of the garage, and twenty minutes later we were on the rode towards Fontenblo (Фонтенбло). 
    
-------

The shadows of trees flew (rushed, streamed) towards the autmobile; the motor worked noiselessly (entirely without noise), and only looking at the meter, I (unwittingly, automatically , unconsciously) tensed all my muscles, almost unconsciously preparing for a terryfying jolt. The road, however (although), was almost entirely deserted, other automobiles were extremely rare (scare, few). Nevertheless (although, however), two times it seemed by miracle, I had escaped, narrowly avoided a catastrophe (an accident). This happened because suddenly my lights had turned off, and out of anxiety (nervousness) I could not find the switch. 
The moon would appear and disappear behind the clouds; it was the hour before dawn. Ahead of me drove a tall freight truck; and everytime, when I approached him (closed the distance), in order to pass, before my eyes would appear a black dot - the appearance of which I could not explain; these kinds of things had never happened to me before. The third time I decided to ignore the black dot, - it had become a little bit lighter (brighter), - and (slammed down, push down) on the gas pedal (accelerator), - only now quite clearly (distinctly) before the very wind shield I discerned the end of a railing, which emerged (stuck out) from the freight trucks (platform ?) by several meters; I hit the break, the (machine, car, automobile) motor car slowed smoothly and the dot moved away. I passed the freight truck and pushed the car to full speed, trying to make up for last time, and a few kilometers later narrowly avoided two twenty-ton (vans, trucks), they were passing each other in opposite directions, but the one which was bound for Paris did not have working headlights, and both of them were lit from a distance with the same three red lights; I saw them along a turn of the read, and concluded that one followed the other, when I had passsed the first of them, the red dots of the second began to approach with an improbabble speed, as if in a dream and only then I realized what the matter was. The automobile was going too fast: if I abruptly hit the breaks, the motor car would turn over, - I had to halt (hinder, slow it) it, pressing down, then letting go of the brake; and when I finally felt, that it was completely under my control, I had time to turn right and the truck passed by with that peculiar hissing and whistling, that is charecteristic (typical) of diesel engines. 
Looking back, I saw that the old man was sitting with his eyes closed; he, by all appearances, was napping and had not noticed anything. Cities and villages, which we passed, were entirely (wholly, completely) empty (deserted) at (in) these hours. Posts indicating the number of kilometers to one city or another passed by. The sun had already risen long ago, and it became hot, I took of my sport jacket. For the first time, when I stopped, to buy gas, the old man took advantage of (used) the pause (break) to ask me, if I could endure (bear, make) the trip to Beaulieu without breaks (stops). 
    - I will be fine, - I said, - but does it not seem to you, that it will be very difficult (very hard on) for you? 
- Nevermind about me, - he said. - I nap the whole time: I can't eat anything anyways. 
    - In that case, - I said, - we will make it. 
But by twelve o'clock in the afternoon I sensed (felt) with alarm, that I was dead-tired; fortunately, by this time there were already many other automobiles on the road and one had to concentrate. Besides this, I smoked cigarrete after cigarrete and, in all, kept myself together. The farther we went however, the harder it became; but we had already passed Toulon. I stopped twice more for gas and finally - it was around eight o'clock in the evening, - we passed Nice and by the road, which I knew as well, as the street in Paris, on which I lived, arrived in Beaulieu. I stopped the automobile before a small (modest) villa, surrounded by palms. I was a bit unsteady (wobbly) - fierey spots (огненные зайчики) darted around in my eyes. I opened the door and helped the old man. 
    - Thank you, mon cher, - he said. - Go get some sleep; when you are rested come back here.. Come tomorow morning. Good night. Do you need money? 
- Yes, I only have four francs in my pocket. 
- I entered the first hotel, ate lunch half-asleep, then entered (went into) the room, barely found the strength to get undressed and fell into a dead man's sleep. 
------
    (It was nine o'clock in the morning when I awoke) I awoke at nine in the morning, having slept eleven hours straight. The room was stuffy, the crackling of cicada's carried over from the nearby garden, and while I had not entirely come to my senses (become conscious, awake) - this took several seconds, the sound especially amazed me. Then a female voice downstairs said, while seeming to grow more distant, answering a person who remained up here - je le crois bien  {Я в это очень верю (фр.).}, - with such a soutern accent, that one could not mistake it, and i instantly remembered the (long, near, endless) journey in the night and the old man, whom I had left yesterday at the entrance of to a villa with palms. On getting dressed, I went to the barber's, then on the way I bought a swimming suit (трусики) and a towel. In the bay, on the shore of which stood Beaulieu, the sea was ideally (idealicly) calm as always; deep under water stones (darkened, lay dark stones), on the coastal (nearby) under water islands (little, small, tiny) algae grew; from which in living (animated, vivacious) fountains swam out whole swarms of small fish; tiny green crabs ran along the stones, on the bottom (sea-floor), and to see them, one had to lie on the water almost unmoving, stomach down, sinking (ducking) their face into the sea and fixedly (intently) looking down. I was once again amazed (marvelled by, поразили) the regular (habitual, every-day) pecuilar silence (quiet) of Bealuie and it's unmoving beauty. (Здесь жили на покое) Life here was tranquil (peaceful, calm, restful) - as along the entire shore of the Mediteranean sea, - but here especially, - very elderly and very tired people, awaiting the deceptively gentle, southern death, in this sea shining from the sun, in this conservatory basin (оранжерейной котловине?). These people lived in the depths of their homes, and even in former times I had seen them not irregularly in Beaulieu, and they were always very dressed (well, up), wore ideally unnecesaryy ties, collars and umbrellas, and the cruel (harsh) southern sun, all the same, apparently, could not warm them all the way through; I thought that to meet them
