The Fate of Salomeya (Судьба Саломеи). Gaito Gazdanov.

I first met Andrei during my student years in Paris. He was a capable man: some of his paintings were valued highly of by very competent people, who were usually not wrong in their judgement and predicted a brilliant future for Andrei. Two or three poems, which he had written in several weeks, were no less outstanding than his pictures. But he didn't have enough creative or spiritual strength to bring whatever he was working on to completion, and time proved that both those who praised his pictures and those who found outstanding qualities in his poetry, were sorely mistaken - not in their assessments of aesthetic merit, but in that Andrei was destined for a brilliant future either in art or in literature. Still in those distant times we all believed in the future and Andrei, in that sense, was no exception. Considerations of an aesthetic nature played a very significant role in his life. And yet the central role in his existence took up those tumultuous emotions, to which he was inclined and which drove of questions of aesthetic nature to the background.

Approximately during those very times, in the Latin quarter and on Montparnasse, there began to appear a certain woman, who was fated to play a very significant role in Andrei's life. One time when she was walking through the cafe with hear head lifted and gazing steadily foward, one of our mates said that she resembles Salome. From that point in time no one amongst us called her any differently. By the way, there was something accurate in that remark: from the side it appeared as if the woman really was carrying an invisible salver in her arms. She was very beautiful. She was so beautiful that even her ridiculous make-up - instead of brows she had two thin black lines abruptly bending upwards, drawn with a black pencil and her lips were painted with carmine of a prevalently purple hue, - even this make up failed to produce that murderous impression which it should have produced. Her hair was colored a pale-yellow color. Later, having made a closer acquintance with her, I learned that every morning she did no less work on her face, than an actor does applying make-up before emerging onto the stage. However, this did not prevent her from repeating that her appearance did not interest her in the least. Of course, if one was confined only to her appearance, she would not have had such success as the one which accompanied her where ever she appeared. Her surname was Martin, she spoke French with mistakes and a foreign accent. Martin she was on account of her husband, who we never saw and who we did not know anything about. When the conversation turned towards that subject, she would say that he no longer exists, exactly like that - il n'existe plus, - although this did not neccesarily mean that he was dead. She herself was Romanian by nationality, and in addition, I think, a mix of gypsy and jewish blood. She joined the historico-philological department of Sorbonne as an auditor, as in her words, she had certain (недоразумения с аттестатом зрелости). Sometime later I came to understand that there never was a diploma and never could have been, although she did say, she had finished some kind of secondary schooling in Romania. She had no clue about such elementary things such as the speed of light, the difference between an arthimetic and a geometric progression, logarithms or the law of gravity. But in the areas of the arts she had a learning that was as vast as it was surprising. At any rate, that was all she was interested in and it seemed that to her everything else was not deserving of any attention. She had very little money, she lived in a small hotel in the Latin quarter. From where she obtained those meager funds for life, which were at her disposal, remained a mystery, until at one point and entirely by chance it was cleared up - every month she received a small sum from that former husband, who, as she said, did not exist. In those times she was twenty-two or twenty-three years old.

That, I think, which she completely could not tolerate, or so it seemed, was simplicity. Simplicity in art or in human relationships were to her something abhorently primitative. This showed itself in even the most ordinary conversations - for example she would never answer a question such as:
    "Will you be at the university tomorrow?"
It was as if she was not capable of giving a straight answer - "yes, I will be",- or "no, I won't be". She would say: "Why does it interest you?" Or: "What difference does it make to you?" Because of this trait any kind of protracted companionship with her became tiresome, even though she was at times a most interesting interlocutor.
She had large gray eyes with an invariably cross expression and even in her laughter one could hear a subtle note of some-kind of incomprehensible, and essentially, objectless ire. Many of her actions were distinguished by their irritating inconsistency. She would agree to go with someone to the cinema, they would go by her hotel, and she would turn out to be away, or to have left a note - I changed my mind. She promised she would be somewhere and would not be. On the otherhand she never forgave inconsistencies or imprecision in others. Although to her it was most often forgiven - because not one of us had any doubts, that beyond these agitating externalities of character, must exist or cannot not exist a whole world, the emotional intensity of which was at the sametime indisputible and irresistibly tempting. One only had to surmount the external obstacles. And for this, to finally penetrate into that world, this was of course worth putting up with.
If not everyone was convinced of this, or rather, was not totally convinced, than Andrei on the other hand was ready to undertake any kind of trial. From the side, one could have thought, that he was created as if entirely to become her victim. From the very beginning there was established that, which determined their relationship: she was permitted everything, and he wans't forgiven a single mistake. Which is to say that a mistake could be anything: a certain intonation, a insufficiently quick or imprecise answer, a spurious movement, - anything at all. He once came to me with an ecstatic expresion, and said that Salome had finally agreed to receive a book of poetry from him as a present, the choice of which she had left to him. But when I met him the next day he was grim, miserable and taciturn.
- What book did you buy her and how was it received? - I asked. He shrugged his shoulders, sighed and replied, that he had bought her Verlaine. She had returned the book to him, saying, that she had no need for it, and besides she would prefer that he did not visit her anymore. He went away in despair, entirely clueless, as to the cause for her sudden and inexplicable temper. Everytime he called her on the phone, she, on recognizing his voice, immedietly hung up the receiver.
    - Let her go to the devil, - I said, when he told me about this.
    - I don't have that emotional capability, - he answered, - If you knew her better, you would understand why.
I felt bad for him and I asked Salome, why she was so cruel with him. I wanted him to buy me Heredia, - she said, - and he's a fool and couldn't figure it out.
I related this to him. Then he bought her a couple of books, Heredia amongst them and left the bag for her at her hotel. A few days later he decided to call her again. He stood at the telephone, swallowing from anxiety, and waiting for an answer. She said:
- Why haven't you called for so long? I've missed you.
The first time he embraced her, she slapped him and said, that this was so low an act that she didn't expect it even from him and that everything was over between them. After this he didn't sleep for two nights. On the evening of the third day she came to him - he had a small apartment by the Bois de Boulogne, in which he lived alone. She entered, looked at him with her ireful eyes and kissed him avidly. She spent all night with him and early morning he took her home by taxi to her hotel. After this, drunk from rapture he came to see me, woke me from sleep and started to yell that I could never understand, that I cannot imagine, what it's like... I had gone to bed late and really wanted to sleep, besides, I actually didn't understand, what could have brought him to such a state. When he finally explained to me, what the matter was, I only said to him:
- Well, I wish you future hapiness, dear friend, - and fell back alseep. When I awoke he was no longer there but the ashtray was filled with butts - he, by all appearances, had spent a couple hours in my room, restoring in memory the details of everything that had occured, and thinking about this blinding happiness.
Much later, trying to understand, what in essence, determined that ridiculous way of living, by which Salome lived and to which, when she could, she compelled others, I came to the conclusion that it was the desire to not accept what was happening but to create that, which ought to happen. He with whom she began a conversation, who she had thought about earlier, had to answer exactly as she had imagined it prior. That, which happened, had to happen exactly as it had happened in her imagination. In all of this was some kind of absurd and incurable egocentricism: and for the actions and behaviour of a person to coincide with her conceptions, they would have to cease to be themselves and become something akin to a book, which she had written. This, of course, could not be, she knew and understood this perfectly well but this inevitably brought her into a fury. More so, she obstinately refused to take responsibility for her actions and for the conclusions which might be drawn from them. When Andrei, came to her on the next evening and put his hand on her shoulder, she threw it off with an abrupt motion, and told him, that she would like him never to do that again. Again he fell into despair - a state, into which he shifted often and very easily. This time around it continued for five days, than there was a repetition of - what had happened last time in his apartment. After a certain time he lost conception of reality entirely, he did not know any thing and was not sure of anything, except that, outside of Salome his life did not have any meaning. This was correct to a certain extent: without Salome his life really did not have any meaning. But with Salome as well - to which, he however would never have assented.
- You are, of course, not the person, whom I really need, - she told him once. - You understand, he to whom I would give myself entirely, would foremost need to be better than me in all ways. All the time I would have to be conscious of his intellectual and physical superiority over me. His understanding of art would need to be flawless. The movements of his spirit would move me with them. It would have to be a person, who is exceptional amongst all others. You understand? And what do you offer? You have some talents, but that's all. That's not enough for me.
Sometime afterwards, Andrei received note, that his father who was living in Toulouse, was seriously ill. Andrei showed Salome the telegram from the doctor and said, that he must go to Toulouse and came to say farewell to her. She glanced at him with her ireful eyes and asked:
- Do you really think, that I would leave you at such a time? Did you really doubt, that I would go with you? You will present me to your father as your bride.
She actually did go to Toulouse with Andrei and spent a whole two months there, during which Andrei's father was dying from cancer of the liver. She displayed extraordinary selflessness, didn't leave his bedsides, didn't sleep for nights - and when after the funeral, they returned to Paris, Andrei, on but a word, was ready to do anything she should ask. I thought then that he was right, when he once told me, that Salome was capable of anything and that her actions could not be predicted.

Once he told her, having gathered enough courage: - You consider yourself more intelligent than everyone who you know? - No, - she said. - I don't consider myself especially intelligent. I only consider others to be stupid, most of them - at any rate.
- Except for that theoretical person, whom you need?
- Except for that person, - said Salome. - She is always of the mind, that what she does is right and that she lives, exactly as one ought to live, - Andrei told me after this, - and to dissuade her of the notion is impossible.
I knew something about her which Andrei did not know. That what had happened yesterday, did not obligate her to anything today, some-kind of signficant part of spiritual life was simply atrophied in her. She had no remembrance. Today's day with the onset of darkness passed into non-being, and that, which had happened during the course of it, ceased to exist. She loved music dearly, although she was entirely bereft of musical hearing and could not distinguish one melody from another. The succession of sounds would bring her into a state of extraordinary spiritual excitation. But she could not commit the sounds to memory. She forgot them, just as she forgot her own feelings, her own life and the lives of those, who was connected to her and who sank away into the past, of which she kept no recollection.
    * * *
Salome and Andrei lived together for several years. She moved away and left him multiple times, he would send her telegramms, long as letters, then she would come back and everything would begin again. Then war was declared and Andrei was mobolized.
Before the German army came to occupy Paris, Salome disppeared. Andrei was a captive in Germany. I heard from one of two mates, that Salome ended up in the south, and took an active part in guerilla activities, supposedly married a Jewish banker during the war-time, refused to leave France with him - and was killed during combat between Guerilla forces and units of the French police. She was buried - in a soldiers grave, somewhere not far from Montpellier. Andrei learned of this only after returning from captivity.

I did not see Andrei for around ten years. When by chance I met him in Paris, I couldnt't recognize him right away, he looked: aged, bald, different. He recognized me. We entered a cafe together, this was on the large boulevards. He immedietly began to talk about Salome, saying, that he had searched for her grave and hadn't found it.
- I don't even have that consolation, - he said. - How she died, what did she think of in those last minutes, whose name did she pronounce?
- You fought in the war, - I said. - How can you ask these kinds of questions? You know that in such circumstances, people more often than not, don't have time to think about anything or to pronounce any names.
- And I was not there next to her! - That's not your fault.
- What I exist for now - I don't know very well. To change the subject, I asked him, what he was working on. An expression of revulsion appeared on his face. What's the matter? I asked.
- I sincerely regret, that I did not die there, where she died, - he said. I live a shameful life.
- That doesn't seem like you.
- Nevertheless it is so. If you only knew, what I do, you would refuse to shake my hand.
- You were always inclined towards overstatment, - I said. - I cannot believe it. What is so shameful about your life?
He explained to me, that during the war he had lost everything, which he had had, and now was compelled to earn a living. He spent a long time looking for work, wrote articles about art, book reviews, but the money which he earned from these was barely enough for food. And then he was made an offer, which he accepted.
- What, do you sell Women, then?
- No, - he said, - even worse. Those that sell women, you understand, they are professional scum. I don't mean to justify them. But they live in their own degenerate world, every minute the threat of prison, police inquiries, public scorn and so forth hangs over their heads. I do work no less vile than they, but with the difference, that nothing threatens me.
- And what is it that you do, after all?
    He winced again in revulsion and said:
- I write verses for songs and lyrics for musicals. You understand? Remember our University years, Mallarme, Valeria, Rilke. And after that...
- Besides this do you write anything? For yourself?
- I tried, he said, I can't. - I am so satured in this musical poshlost [1] and idiocy, that I feel like I am chronically poisoned.
Then he looked at me with despair and said: - Can you imagine, what Salome would have said were she alive? Of course, that was something he often thought about, what Salome would have said.
Characteristic of his current life, besides the added years and unremitting remembrance of Salome, was that which before had also been one of his main attributes: he lived not as he would have liked and yet did nothing to alter his way of living. In essence, nothing forced him to invariably engage in that occupation, which he considered shameful. Yet he could not make the effort that was neccesary in order to rid himself of it.

In all, nothing remained to him: not those vague hopes of some-kind of future in art that he had had in his youth, neither that meaning in life, which he had found in Salome. And of course, for a person with his aesthetic views that which he was compelled to occupy himself with was the lowest possible level of decline. It was difficult to hope, that now, at his age, he would suddenly begin another life, in this he was prevented, in part, by his remembrance for Salome: no other woman could ever take her place. And so since, years and years had passed since that day on which they had parted, and his remembrance of her remained the same as it was in the very beginning, it seemed obvious that nothing could be changed at this point. I learned sometime later, that he had written a whole book about her. Not one publisher would take it, because Salome was painted in such a false and naively romantic way, that it made the entire book about her entirely unconvincing.
Of course, I thought about Salome as well. What was left of her? Our memories of her and the story of her tragic death, which at one time was written of in the papers but now was forgotten as almost everything, which had occured during the years of war. And yet, thinking about Salome, one could theoretically assume that only death stopped her on that path, to which she was destined and which, maybe, would have been brilliant. And of course, had she been alive, Andrei's life would have turned out differently as well.
A year after my meeting with him, travelling through Italy, I stayed for sometime in Florence. I lived on the Via del Proconsulo, in a small boarding house with an owner, whom I would share long conversations with in the evening. He was an elderly Italian, and spoke to me in a language, which he sincerely considered to be French but which in reality was a product of his personal creative efforts and was equally distant both from Italian and from French, reminiscient of one and the other at the same time. He told me about his neighbors - the owner of the book store, the owner of the cafe, his tenants, and the residents of Florence in general; he talked about the fate of Italy and even about art, which, in his opinion, ceased to exist, in the firt half of the 17th century. He spoke once about the war, which had forced many Florentines to leave their native city, which in other circumstances they would never have left, to risk their lives in strange countries, in cold Russia, in hot Africa, in France. Amongst this he related to me the story of a shoemaker, who lived not far from his boarding-house and had once been tenant, the shoemaker was born and raised in Florence, the thought of leaving his street and his city never even entered his mind. An excellent shoemaker and a good man. And then, during war time, he was mobolized and ended up in that section of the Italian army which had occupied the south of France. After Italy's defeat he joined somekind of French guerilla unit where he was heavily wounded. Only several years later when the war had ended, he finally returned to Florence. From France, by the way, he had brought with him a french girl, that was also unnecessary, there are enough italian girls in Florence. Yet he married his French girl and returned to shoemaking, which he never should have left. His wife assists him. She is older than him, and didn't know a thing about shoemaking at first, but now she has learned to do good work.
    And what did she do in France?
- She was, probably, a poor lonely woman, - he said. - She was fortunate, she found a man with  good trade, he doesn't do too badly, last year they even went to the sea during the summer. And, look, at how the fate of these people was contrived. He could have never left here, and she would have continued her lonely life in France. He would have lacked her, and she would have lacked him. But since Mussoluni joined the war, because he considered himself to be somekind of Italian Napoleon, our shoemaker ended up in France and she came to Florence, a city she might not even have known about before.
Probably, I was significantly less inclined towards philosophizing, than the owner of my boarding-house because the story of the Florentine shoemaker did not make any particular impression. Any detail in the sculptures of Michelengelo, in the bronze of Donatello or Beneveniento Chellini seemed to me infinetly more important in the history of humanity, then this or that war, the death of one dictator or another or the fate of their compatriots, including the florentine shoemaker and his wife. I was thinking then of other things, and in particular, that, everytime, that I was able to escape, the life which I was living and which was surrounded on all sides by essentially insignificant, ideas and concerns, and returned to the contemplation of the paintings of (Тинторечто) or Botticelli or the statues of Michelangelo, I (fell into, went into) a state of ecstatic (frantic) and tragic rapture (ecstasy), compared to which everything else seemed entirely insignificant.
One evening I was walking through the city, with no particular purpose, thinking about this - and then remembered one of the conversations, I had with Andrei many years ago. We were walking then down the Boulevard ( Я. St.  Michil), it was a clear september night. Several days earlier he had returned from Venice, where he had been for the first time, and told me about his impressions. Of everything he had seen, he best remembered - Donatello's John the Baptist and Tintoretto's Ascension.
- A tall beggar in the bronze folds of his rags, whom it is impossible to forget, - he said. - And "Ascension". You understand: a numerous angel's wings, flying upwards, and in the middle of this indomitable motion is Christ, ascending to the heavens. What kind of monstorous genius one must have, to create such a thing. Afterwards it seems, that to live, the way one has done until now, is no longer tolerable.
- It always seems to me that to live as we do, is intolerable, - I said. Maybe what you saw in Venice, only highlights that, makes those notions more prominent, if you will, but if you make the effort to recall what you thought before your trip to Italy, you will find, that you knew this before as well.
- Yes, but not in the same way, - he said, - and not that. What, really kills me, you know, is the simaltenous and parralel existence of such different worlds and the unbearable diversity of sensations, which no force of imagination can unite into a whole. Everyone of us leads several existences and the huge distance that seperates them is incomprehensible and frightening to me. I cannot find myself within there.
He stopped and lowered his head - and from the side the impression was, that at night on the boulevard a person is standing and scrutunizing his feet. Then he lifted his head and said:
- I cannot understand, how a person, who watches the overflowing of a symphony as it rises and expands, afterwards, suddenly and miraculously contracts and returns to two notes, from which it was born, - I am thinking now of Beethoven's fifth symphony - a person, who during the course of long minutes lives in this world and into who forever entered this extraordinary movement of sounds -  how can such a person after all this, on leaving the concert hall, painlessly return to that, which had been until then.
- I don't see an irreconcilable contradiction in this, - I said.
- I am not talking about contradiction, I am not comparing the insights of art with other human emotions, - he said. - But I am frightened by the distance which divides into seperate worlds that space in which I had lost myself, one time long ago and in which I can no longer find myself.
- Maybe, genius, in part, posses the capacity for simultaneous insight in all of these separate worlds - that ability of which mere mortals are deprived. Not an insight into a theoretical concept, into which with equal right would enter all the human emotions with their improbable multiplicity, - but something else - a primordial and flawless insight into the whole.
- It maybe, - he said. - But in that case it should be said that the comprehension of genius is beyond our reach. Not its manifestation but its nature.
I was now walking down a long and narrow Florentine street. It was late night with motionless air and a starry sky. A quarter century ago, in Paris, when we conversed with Andrei, the same unanswerable questions occupied my attention. If someone had told me then, that we would live twenty-five more years, through a devestating war, bear witness to the deaths of millions - and after all this would still return to the same questions, I would not have believed them. I would have said, that this cannot be, that what awaits us is a slow and natural spiritual rigormosis, through which we will slowly approach death, everything will gradually loose meaning - the feelings of other people, and works of arts, and the nature of genius. Yet it turned out otherwise. Everyone of us was given a particular world, the laws of which did not change with time. And on account of this I was in Florence thinking about the same things, about which I thought about in Paris - with the same fruitless and hopeless persistence. And on account of this Andrei lived such a life as he did, disgusted with himself and thinking about what Salome would have said.

    X   X   X
Once during the day I was walking first down via Ghibellina, then I turned onto a narrow street, running at a right-angle to it. Very poor people lived here - occupying themselves with the collection of scrap metal. The first person I saw, was a swarthy boy of around fifteen, with an a expression of naive truimph he carried in his hands several rusted springs from some kind of derelict couch. Through the thin entrances into homes sometimes yards could be seen, cluttered with rusted metal of the most diverse origins. Reaching the middle of the street, I saw the workshop of that very same shoemaker, who the owner of my boarding-house had told me about. He was a wide-shouldered man with dark skin: in scant lighting - the street was dark - his motionless face appeared to me as if it were a bronze cast. Across from him sat his wife, that very same woman, whom he had brought from France. When I stopped by his window, she raised her head and looked at me - and I had to make an effort - to not cry out in surprise. I met the familiar and unchanged gaze of ireful gray eyes and recognized Salome.

I turned around and quickly went back to my boarding-house. There I called the housemaid and asked her to take a note down to the shoemaker's wife. In that note I asked Salome to come to the station at seven o'clock on the next evening, where I would wait for her.
After the war, when I was told that she had been killed, I had experienced a of deep feeling of grief. But that was nothing in comparison to the cold despair, which engulfed me that evening while I waited for her at the station. By the table at which I sat passed tourists: Germans, Englishmen, Americans, Frenchmen, their words reached me but I heard them without comprehending their meaning. I saw the face of Andrei before me - not the bald man, who now wrote lyrics for songs, feeling disgusted with himself and his clients but the Andrei of twenty-fivers years ago, with his distant and exalted eyes, and heard his words: - No, you cannot understand, you'll never understand. No, this was too cruel. If Salome had been alive...
I thought that she would not come. But she came. When she came near to my table I stood up and moved a chair out for her, she looked at me intently - as if she were afraid of something. I had not known such an expression in her eyes. Swallowing from anxiety, I asked:
- How could all of this had happened? And without answering my question, she asked:
- Is he alive?
- He is. He thinks - as I did, up until yesterday, - that you were killed. Although now he bears very little resemblance to who he was before the war, as you do not resemble who you were.
- Do you find I have changed much? No, in external appearance she had changed less, than one could expect. Her face had grown heavier, wrinkles had appeared above her mouth but she still looked very fine.
- I did not mean external resemblance. But you haven't answered me, how did all of this happen? I repeat, we were all sure, you had been killed in the south of France during the war.
- I was very heavily wounded, - said Salome. - I thought that I would die, I didn't doubt it. From there it was the ordinary fairy tale, you know the kind they write in stupid sentimental books: a young italian found me, carried me to the hospital and than came to visit me everyday. A week later the doctor told me that I would live.
    She took and lit a cigarrete. I remembered, that before she didn't smoke.
- Do you remember, what it was like during the war? For many people, including myself, everything complicated disappeared. Only the simplest things remained: hunger, danger, fear of death, cold, pain, weariness and the unconscious understanding that everything in life is simple and terrible. And all that one can wish for is warmth, sleep, food, safety, a roof over one's head - what else?
- Yes, yes, I undertand, - I said. - But the stone age comes to an end.
- When we came to Florence afterwards, - she said, - the war was over, there was no more danger. Small childeren were playing in the streets, the sun was shining, it was warm. Yet everything that was before had ceased to exist. Have you not noticed, that that the world, which existed before the war, no longer exists?
-One could say that even if the war had never happened. Of course that world no longer exists. But the one which has replaced it, did not inevitable have to be limited to the shoemaker's window on a narrow street, emerging onto via Ghibellina, and the things of which your life now consists. Was it worth living such a life, to pass through such trials and surive - so that everything would end like this? It seems to me, that you deserve better.
- Are you so sure, that that which you are thinking of, is better? - No, - I said. Maybe, it is from a defeciency of the imagination, but still it seems to me, one cannot maim their existence more than you have done. I remember, that in former times you dreamed of something different.
- And maybe, happiness is in that, we are able to limit ourselves and understand that what's most important - is a few simple things?
- Tens of millions of people live that way. But there are others, for whom it is not enough.
I looked into her eyes and was suddenly astonished to see a (calm, relaxed, tranquil, mellow, unperturbed) and indifferent expression, along with that light tint of superiority, which I had known from before but only now seemed out-of-place and inexplicable. The despair from earlier engulfed me, I thought, that it couldn't be left like this. I said:
- I propose the following. We will leave here. My car is around the corner. I will stop for a few minutes at the boarding-house and pay. Do you have some kind of identification? Tomorow we will be on the French border. Tomorow evening you will be in Paris, and a week later you will have forgotten everything that preceded your return.
    - No, - she said. - You will leave Florence and return to Paris without me.
- You categorically refuse to come? - What would I do - in a strange far away city?
Only in the first minute of conversation with her I had heard an emotion (disturbance, excitement, agitation, волнение) in her voice, it was when she had asked if Andrei was alive. The rest of the time she was unperturbed (calm, unmoved) a state entirely unusual to her former self.
- You forget about time, my friend, -  she said, rising. - That which you live in, is the play of shadows. From he who you once were, the most important aspect is missing, and you obstinately refuse to accept that. You want to turn back time - even God cannot do that. If I listened to you and left with you for Paris, I would lose that which I have now and would be left in an emptiness which cannot be filled with any rememberance. Walk me home. Because now I have a home, you know? I did not have one before, I did not know that concept.
We left the station. I walked for sometime without speaking. Then I said, repeating her words:
- "I would lose that which I have". In other words the company of a person who does not understand one tenth, of what you understand?
- When I saw you in the window, it shocked me, - she said. - And I knew that you would not understand what I would tell you. Maybe you will understand later. But for that you would have to imagine a completely different world, from the one you know and in which I live.
- That's some kind of literature.
- No, literature is over for me, - she said. Literature - is your domain. And until you seperate yourself from it, you won't understand what is important.
We walked together to the corner of via Ghibellina.
- Do you recall? - I asked. - Rue ve Vagirard, rue Monsier le Prince, rue de Tournon, rue de Buci, boulevard St. Germain, rue de Saints Peres?
- Yes, I'm remembering, - she said. But those that lived there in those times, no longer exist. Goodbye.
She walked a few steps, than came back and said:
- I didn't give you a proper farewell. She pressed her strange lips to mine for a second and went away. My eyes followed her - she had preserved her straight and supple step, for which she had been called Salome. Then I returned to the station. From there I rode to my boarding-house and lay half the night, without sleeping, intently following after what she called the movement of shadows, - outside of which she now lived, and I could not imagine my existence.
When I returned to Paris, I kept remembering my conversation with Salome. Everything that she had said, could not explain that irreversible transformation which had happened to her. That which I had considered her shortcoming, that deficiency of remembrance, had now saved her: if she understand that, which was before, she would be unable to live like that. Her transformation had happened, it seemed to me, because she had seen death in front of her. Reached it and than experienced the animal joy of returning to life. And the only circumstances which she did not forget, were precisely those, from when she realized this return to life, for which she was obliged to a young Italian. The last face, which she had seen before her, when she thought that she was about to die was his face. And the first, which she saw with different eyes, when she sensed that she would live, was his face. That was the strongest and only remembrance, that determined her transformation and her current life. The instinct towards self-preservation had closed before her all that she had formerly known, and that is why my appearance at the shopfront shocked her, as she said. That which I proposed to her - to return to Paris, - of course, was impossible, because there was no room for that city in which she once had lived in her current life. And I thought of Andrei, to whom of course, I couldn't tell about Salome; he would have thought that it was a result of a tragic misunderstanding or a betrayal. But it was neither a misunderstanding or a betrayal. It was death. Not of Salome, who now lived on a small street emerging on to via Ghibellina, but of that world, a part of which she had been for us, which genuinely no longer existed, but without the spectral remembrance of which we could not conceive of our own existences.
It was winter when I met Andrei in a small cafe on the corner of rue le Buci and Bouleard St. Germain, when I came in to drink a coffee. He looked as sad as always and now I felt especially bad for him, because I so distinctly remembered that September night in Florence, when I had parted with Salome. With talked of various things, and then he returned the conversation to that which had been before the war, and again began to speak, inevitably - about Salome and said:
- You might consider it sentimentalism, but I would at least like to know, where her grave is. You know that I searched for it and wasn't able to find it.
- Probably, - I said - because you did not have the right information and searched for it in the wrong places.
