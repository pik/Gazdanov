Above, along the champs-elysees, where in this winter time already from four o'clock electric advertisments were lit and huge cafe windows came to life, came freezing rains mixed with snow, while below, in the long passages of the metro, the air was warm and immobile. In the middle of one of these passages, always in the same place, stood an old, ragged man without a hat, with a dirty-rose colored bald spat, around which above his sideburns and his temple, grayed hairs pointed out in all directions. As most of the Parisian homeless, he was dressed in something formless. His cape and his pants had such a look, as if they had never been any different, as if they were made to order just so, with those soft folds with the absence of even the slightest bit defined line sor countours, as dresses or shirts, in which people might dress, were they dwellers of some kind of other world, rather than the one, which surrounded them. This person stood not far from a blind youth, playing on his harmonica hours without end the same melody - Ravel's "Bolero", standing between two advertisements: on one was pictured a mustached gentleman, holding a cup of coffee in his hands, the certificate of quality was stamped at the bottom, at the place, where the body of the gentleman was cut off with a straight line, under which it was written, that better coffee does not exist. On the second advertisement a young blond with a blissfully happy expression on her porecloin-rose face appeared occupied hanging linen-sheets of dead-white color on a rope, washed in warm water, into which a special powder was poured, giving never-before seen whiteness to the material. The huge white sheets bearing these advertisements had hung in the same places for years, just as, for years the beggar had stood in the same place, just as unmoving, as the mustached man with the cup of coffee and the blonde with her frozen arm on the paper, reaching for a bedsheet. But he did not see the advertisements; more accurately, they did not trigger any kind of reflection in his eyes, if he were asked, what was on these sheets of paper, he would not be able to remember. 
But no one asked him about anything. 
Already for many years, since the time he had become a beggar, one of the particular aspects of his existence was that, he almost stopped speaking, not only because, he did not want to do so, but also because, in doing so there was no necessity. Words, and their meaning, had long ago lost for him their previous meaning, as did everything, which preceded his current life. One time he saw some thrown away newspaper: it lay on the gray floor of the metro passage with huge letters were printed the words "War in Korea". He looked at the newspaper with his faded eyes and did not remember (store to memory) the combination of letters, or their meaning. This war, whose events were attended to by millions of people around the whole world (consumed, directed the attention of), for him did not exist, as there was nothing else at all, except for his personal long-lasting derangement (bred), through which  he slowly and unfaltering (ly, steadily) came ever nearer to death. Sometimes, when he was leaving the Metro at night and walking along the deserted streets of Paris, across the whole city to the vacant lot on the edge, where stood a huge wooden box, in which he spent the nights, he would be stopped by policemen and asked, what he was called, where he lives and whether he had any money. Not looking at those, who were asking him these questions, he answered that he was named Gustav Verde and that he lived by the Porte d'Italie. Then he would take out and show a few credit notes from his pocket, always the same ones. The police let him go, and he would continue on his way. Late at night he would arrive at his box, open the boarded door which locked on a hook, bent down, entered and right away went to sleep on the mattress, which served as his bed. He had inherited this box, after the old man, also homeless, as himself, who had built it himself and got a mattress somewhere, died on a summer night from a heart attack, and was found several days later by policemen, who discovered of his death because it was hot and his corpse had began to rot. When the box was freed, Gustav Verde came there, and remained there ever since. The box was satured with the stench of death (the corpse), to which he had become accustomed and which afterwords gradually changed, acquiring still newer and newer notes (nuances). At first (on entering?) the stench (захватывало  дух) was overpowering; but than it became easier, as if in this poisoned air there was established somekind of indefinite equilibruium between the danger of suffocating and the ability to breath. In this box, from the old man, who had died in it, remained a small mirror from polished steel - everything, which was reflected in it, took ot a cold metallic hue; a candle remained as well, a box of Sulphurous matches, a basin for water, a small bucket, a jagged (rough, dented) shaving razor, a piece of soap and a gray rag, (thinned out so) which shone through with light and served him as a towel. All of this, part of that final conception of the world, which the old man took away with him into his grave, was on a cardboard box from canned goods, aside from the bucket, standing in the corner. (aside from this) The old man had nothing at all. 
All of this - the box with the matress, and the long hours in Metro passages, and slow nighly rambling through the sleeping city, and the fact, that most people he met or that walked by him, obviously avoided him and looked at him with an unseeing gaze, as if looking at an empty space, all of this came to him in the course of the last few months and weeks in especially  dim and indefinite contours, as if through a eveil of fog. He had long ago forgotten, that it's possible to feel the desire to eat (hunger); he never had to starve, there was always money for a piece of bread, cheese and wine; more so, early morning in the rubbish bins, standing in the streets, it was easy to find remenants of food thrown out by housekeepers (хозяйками);  
at the central marketplace it was enough to walk a small distance, to fill a bag with vegetables, picked up from the ground. But now, to fill himself, he needed very little. He fell asleep and woke up with the same noise in his head, which had began not to long ago (recently) and through which all the other sounds reached him only muffled and unclear. Sometimes he had this feeling, as if his chest was suddenly grasped by a metal hoop, he began to suffocate, and everything, that was happening around him, sank away in this feeling of pain and ceased to exist. Then he would close his eyes and lean against the wall, almost loosing consciousness. But after a few minutes the pain would fade, he would open his eyes again and look forward dimly at the gray walls surrounding him, at the people, who passed by, at the advertisements, which he also did not see. He had long ago stopped thinking not only about specific things, but altogether; this was the same, as the vanished need to speak. And in this mute and thoughtless life, there remained only changing impressions - noise in the head, pain, sleep, skin rashes from insect bites, the heavy stench of the box, which he felt, entering there after being out in the air for a long time, cold, heat, thirst. 
And then of late something new was added to this, it was also an impression, but a very pecuiliar one, icy and immobile. And then for the first time in the last years he made an effort (over himself) from which he had grown unaccustomed, thought about it, and suddenly understood the meaning of the noise in his head, the sensation of the steel hoop accross his chest. He remembered his age - he was seventy-six years old, - and it became clear to him, that his long life was coming to an end and that there was nothing now which could change this. From that day forward, standing in the metro passage, closing, or opening his eyes, he again began to think, about that which occupied his mind so many years ago. This was endlessly long ago, long before, he became like he was today. The question, which stood (immobile) before him at the time, and to whihc, he knew it then as he did now, there was no and could be no answer, - it was the question of what meaning, there was in his life, why it was necessary, and for what mysterious cause came this long movement (was born generated), which had now brought him here, into this warm stone tunnel under the champs-elysees. Through the noise in his head he heard again the melody, which the blind youth played on his accordion. Till now he had been so far removed from what was around him (the world), that he perceived the music only as a mechanical irritation of his hearing, not giving himself any account of what it is. Now he suddenly recognized the melody and remembered, that it was Rauvel's "Bolero", which he had heard in earlier times and couldn't stand; to him it always seemed, that in this demented repeating rhytmn of the same barbarian sounds, and in their wild (savage) and primitive rhymths there was something, disturbing the nerves (nervous system). "Bolero" (caused) in him almost a physical repulsion. When had he heard it last? He made an effort and remembered, that it was long ago, at a concert. He clearly saw before himself the concert hall, the (tail-coat) evening-suit of the conductor, his bald head, rows of chairs (arm), a multitude of familiar faces, male and female, which appeard before him either in the frames of black&white tuxedo's, collar's and ties, or in faded colors of powedered flesh, woman's necks and shoulders, breaking there, where dresses ended, above whose cut lines shined with various colors and hues jewelry. He remembered how the conductor jerked sposmadically to the rhymth of the music and how in the same jerking motion up and down along the strings moved violin bows. He sat than in the second row, without turning his head toward his wife, so as not to see her face and the expression of cold-stupidity in her eyes. It had been a December evening with the same icy rain, as now, but in the concert hall it was warmer, than in the metro passages. After the concert there was (he recalled) a night-time restaurant, white wine and oysters, inside the restaurant it was just as unpleasant, as in the concert hall, and he looked with dreariness, how untiring (incessantly) moved the fat fingers of his wife, with which she held the oystershells, and he thought about, when he would finally be home and left alone, with the sensation of illusionary and short-timed freedom. And then returning home, into the neighborhood of Paris, where the villa stood, in which he lived, that he entered his bedroom and closed the door, - this, in essence (essentially), was just like his returning into the box in which he lived now, only with the difference that now he was free. 
The blind youth ceased to play for a time, and "Bolero" faded into silence. The old man continued to think, still trying to understand something, that it seemed to him, was exceptionally important, a possibility of some kind of explanation for everything, which kept slipping away from him. He was free now - because he wasn't needed by anybody; he had neither possesions or money, nor the possibility (ability, opportunity) of having some kind of influence on anyone else, nor the ability to harm or help anyone else in any way, in other words, nothing, that connected him with other people established some kind of connection between themselves and him. He did not even have a name, because people with his same last name were thousands and thousands, so he became almost anonymous and to thought wouldn't occur to anyone, that the homeless man with a dirty-rose bald sport and it's surrounding bourdier of gray hair, standing in the corridors under the champs-elysees, and that Verde, who was a tthe concert, where Rauvel's Bolero was played, and about whose disappearance newspapers had written many years ago, had anything at all in common. No one had a clue as to the reasons for this (his) disapperance, and not one of the assumptions, which were made then in the newspaper articles, carried even the slightest relation to reality (actuality) - suicide, an irrepressible (unquenchable) lust for some unknown woman, a double life, which had perceeded this one, the state of his business affairs. The affairs turned out to be entirely in order, there was no double life, as there was neither lust nor an unknown woman. People that belonged to the same sphere, as him, were unable to understand, how a man like Verde, could refuse the life, which he had led, to become homeless and a beggar -- without being forced (the cause of such a change) to make such a change (being in) some kind of ruling rationale (overpowering reasons, causes for such a change), - bankrupty, devastation, insanity, alcoholism. Yet none of it was - and because of that, in the sphere of those conceptions, which governed all actions in that (reality, world, strata), there was no and could not be any explanation (reasoning) for what happened. There were in this strata, people of so called progressive views; some of them wrote historical or sociological research (investigations) about the causes of this or that revolution or riot amongst dispossed people against their fate, and those, whom they considered to at fault for it (at the cause of it), against the owning class. But to none of the authors of these investigations could occur the thought, that it was possible for there to be a voluntary rejection of that very same well-to-doness, and the heart of the problematic and impossibility of which, in their opinion -- occured revolutions. And it was just as natural for them to imagine a poor man, who is striving for well-todoness (material comfort) and wealth as it was unnatural for them to image the motion in reverse, i.e. a wealthy man striving to be poor. Verde understand this perfectly (had an excellent understanding of this). Of these words - wealth, poverty, rebellion, - one could make various combinations; but the main word, was after all the word "rebellion". Verde did not have any hatred towards wealth and did not have any attraction towards poverty or homelessness. Yet his entire life - up until the point, when he acquired his freedom, having rejected, that which others considered to be of the greatest blessings,
