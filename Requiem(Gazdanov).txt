Requiem 

Those were (it was during, this happened) the harsh (cruel) and sad times when the German's occupied Paris (of the german occupation of Paris). The war was overtaking more and more space. Hundreds of thousands of people moved along the frozen roads of Russia, battles were being fought in Africa, bombs were exploding over Europe. Come evening (at night) Paris plunged into an icy darkness, streetlights did not glow anywhere, and windows were not lit. Only on rare winter nights, the moon would illuminate (when the moon illuminated) this frozen, almost spectral (phantasmal) city, as if it had been created by someone's monstorous imagination and forgotten in the apocolyptic nethers (depths) of time. In many storied buildings, which had long ago ceased to be heated, an icy dampness (stood, maintained). In the evenings in apartments with tightly (densly, thickly) covered windows the glass boards of radio sets lit up and through the (треск глушения) cracks of static a voice came: "Ici Londres. Voici  notre  bulletin d'information..."
People were badly (poorly, shoddily) dressed, the streets were mostly vacant, automobile traffic had ceased long ago, carriages drove along the city, bridled with horses, and this also strengtehned (heightened, enchanced) the impression (sensation) of the tragic and unbelievable nature of what was happening, in which the entire country dwelled (inhabited lived) over the course of several years. 
In those times I came once to a small cafe, on the outskirs of Paris (suburbs), where I had a meeting with a chance acquintance. It was evening, during the harsh (cruel, severe) winter of forty-two. The cafe was filled with people. By the barstand stood well dressed people - scarves, fur collars, ironed suits, - drank cognac, coffee with rum and liquor, ate sandwiches with ham, which I had not seen for a long time. I learned later, the explanation for the ham, the cognac, and everything else: the regulars of the cafe, which I had visited by chance, were Russians, engaged (dealing) on the blackmarket. Before the war, during times of peace and plenty, most of these people were jobless, - not because they did not find work, but because, they did not want to work from somekind of incomprehesinble and stubborn refusal to live, as everyone around them did: shifts at the factory (ходить на завод), a room in a shoddy hotel and wages once every two weeks. These people lived in the state of chronic and most frequently unconscious rebellion against the European reality, which surrounded them. Many of them spent nights in wooden baracks, nailed together from boards, gloomy and (rotting?) turning dark on the weedy vacant grounds of the parisian outskirts. They knew all the doss-houses (ночлежные дома) of Paris, scanty yellow light over metal bed frames of large dormitories, the damp coolness of these gloomy spaces, the constant sour reek (stench). They knew the salvation army, dens and the poor man's cafe (нищие кафе place Maubert), where the collectors of cigarrete butts gathered, torpid (benumbed) sleep on the benches of underground metro stations and endless rambling (wandering) through Paris. Many of them had riden through (travelled, traversed) and trekked the French provnices - - Лион, Ницца, Марсель, Тулуза, Лилль.
And afterwards, when the German army (came to, had) occupied more than half of the French country (territory), remarkble changes happened in these peoples lives. They were presented with a sudden and wondorous opportunity to get rich - without significant and, in essence (essnetially), almost without working. The Germany army and the organization associated with it, bought in bulk, without bargainingm, all goods, which they were offered: boots and tooth brushes, soap and nails, gold and coal, clothes and axes, electrical wires and machinery, cement and silk - everything. These people became the middlemen between the German buyers and the French business men, selling their products. And as if in an Arabian (folk) tale, yesterday's jobless became rich. 
They were living now in warm apartments, whose previous owners had left them, leaving paintainings of strange (incomprehensible) contents (scenery), good carpets and comfortable arm-chairs. On their arms they wore gold watches with gold bracelets, on their fingers they wore rings with real precious stones. Each of them had a difficult (had had) life in the past - cities, roads and streets in various countries, huge distances, which they had covered on foot, - and now had finally reached, that which they had never dreamed about. 
At first I met one of them (made acquintance with), Grigori Timofeivich, a skinny aged (немолодым) man with deep seated eyes anda  sharp chin. I met him at my friends, a former singer, who had performed in the (кабаре) and the Cafe back in his day. But in those times, when I knew him, all of it had gone away into the past (author incr.?). He was gravely ill with consumption and rarely rose from his bed. Everytime that I visited him, with thinned out arms he would take down from the wall a huge guitar, (sounding like a grand piano) and sang in his deep voice, which in some astonoshing (marvelous, amazing) way had not beed affected by his sickness, all kinds of romances and songs - and I would be astonished (amazed) at the wealth of his reptoire. Gregori Timofeevich had known him from childhood, both of them were native (orginally from) some small city under (south of) Orlom. No one except myself, ever called Grigori Timofeevich by his name and patronymic, he was always Grisha; or Grishka. The singer, (on the otherhand) in contrast no one ever called by name, but everyone called Vasiliy Ivanovich. 
    -So, Vasiliy Ivanovich, I bought, you know, a painting - Grisha was saying one time. - By the way I brought you some fried duck. 
- Thanks, - said Vasiliy Ivanovich. - So what is this painting that you bought Grisha? 
    - The painting, Vasiliy Ivanovich, is no simple thing. The amount I paid for it - it's scary to mention. But the scene is very magnificent. 
- What's pictured on it? 
    - A great Eagle, is pictured on it, Vasiliy Ivanovich, and it is flying somewhere, and on it's back, you know, there's a young man, that it seems to be carrying away. It doesn't quite make sense, I know, but the Eagle, I'll tell you, there's never been a better one. I've looked at this painting many a time - and everytime it's the same thing: a magnficent (wonderful) painting, nothing else to say. 
- And who is the artist?
    - That I don't know, - said Grisha, - someone very famous. The seller told me the last name, but I forgot. Only I remembered that he said, that in comparison to him, Repin (Репин), he said, is just like a hunk of wood. And he told me the name of the painting as well, but I, you know, didn't even hear him, that's how wonderstruck I was. 
    I saw this painting later in Grisha's apartment: it was a copy of Ruben's "Похищения Ганимеда". 
Paintings, it should be said, were bought by all, or almost by all regulars of that cafe, just as they bought gold ornaments, or coins. For in these people, who had never had anything, suddenly awakened a sudden (gusto, impetuous, fit) impetuous and disordered greed, never, however, taking on the western form of mechanical accumulation of money. They spent even more, they spent without any sense and aimlessly, with some kind of (special, particular) particular ridiculousness. I remember one of them, a tall and cheerless man with a black beard; he was called Spiridon Ivanovich. He was standing outside the cafe and drinking cognac. At this time down the street came a glazier, shouting with a ringing voice: 
    - Vitrier! Vitrier! 2
    - I can't stand these shouts, - said Spiridon Ivanovich. - I really can't, the nerves aren't as they used to be. And this useless shouting, come, who needs him? 
    The shout came again from the street: 
    - Vitrier! Vitrier!
    Spiridon Ivanovich ran out of the cafe, went over to the glazier and told him in Russian: 
    - (Не надрывай ты мне душу), jesus christ, be quiet! How much does all of your junk cost? 
    Then realizing (?), he repeated his question in broken French. The surprised glazier, after some hesitation, answered. Spiridon Ivanovich took out his wallet, paid the cost of his entire merchandise, waited until the glazier had left, and returned to his place at the bar to finish his congac, which had a specially fine gurgle to it as it poured into his throat, accompanied by the movement of his sharp adam's apple. 
-- All day it's drudgery, - mumbled Spiridon Ivanovich, - start in the morning, something wasn't shipped, somewhere else they didn't have product, and then it's this, (еще  душу человек надрывает). Only rest one can get is in the evening. You come home, turn on (light up) the heat lie down in bed. You lie and think: you've made it, Spiridon Ivanovich, made it, finally. It's time for us lads to rest, not to argue with glazier's а не со стекольщиками лаяться, to rest. 
    - You'll rest plenty in the next world, Spiridon Ivanovich, said Volodya, an athletic man of around forty, a specialist in gold. - I do presume there shouldn't be any glaziers there, why would there be glass? Just clouds and angels, nothing more. 
    - And no gold either, - said one of the occupants (those present). 
- Well that remains to be seen, - said Volodya. - One time I was in the Cathedral de Notre Dame, they have a  charity-box hanging there. I look, and there it says on it: "for the souls, of those in purgatory". That means that into purgatory, somekind of funds can be transfered. 
    - That's their catholic business, - said Grigori Timofeevich. - The money of course, goes to the church, so that they will pray here, for those, who they think, must be in purgatory. But you're right there, the way they wrote it is strange, for sure. 
For some reason I especially remembered this day, when Spiridon Ivanovich was (declaiming, reciting) giving his monolog - the (husky) rasping sound of his voice, the movement of his adam's apple on his long and hin neck and those words - time for us lads, to rest, - I remembered the expression of his drunk and tired eyes, the winter twilight and the various smells of alcohol in the cafe. 
    And when Grigori Timofeevich left, Volodya told me: 
    - That was poor of me, to speak of the other world, would have been better to not say anything. I'm worried for Grisha, we all feel for him. He's a good man, only he won't make it, he's had consumption for a long time. 
Then Volodya began to speak of his affairs. His conversation, as always, was overfilled with technical terms, percents, alloys, carrots, (то  или  иное гранение камней) one or another method of cutting. It was clear, that hardly could he have, in this short time, that had passed since the day that the Germans occupied Paris, have masterd all of these things. When I asked him once, where it is the he knows all these things from, he answered, that he was always interested in everything related to gold and jewelery. Before the war, he as all his other friends in the cafe, were most often jobless and not infrequently homeless. He had spent whole hours before the showcases of jewlery stores on the rue de la Paix, read with a dictionary some kind of technical books, knew, at what tempertures this or that metal would met, what areas of industry make use of platinum, - and this ragged and in those times almost a beggar of a man, might have been an expert in jewelery. But before the war his interest in all of this carried a strictly selfless character, and he never imagined himself, that there would come a day, when all of that showcased and unattainable gold would suddenly be within his grasp. According to him, only once had he met a suitable (worthy) conversation partner (interlocutor), that knew everything as well as himself: it was a hollander, with a feather-white (белокурой) beard and blue eyes, a well-known breaker of strong-box safe's, with whom Volodya sat a couple of hours in the common cell of the Central Paris jail, where he had ended up for homelessness, - that is for the crime - of not having any money, or a permenant address. 
Looking at Volodya, I quite often returned to the thought, about, to what extent arbitrary can be so called class (social)-distinctions: this homeless man should on all accounts have been an owner of a large jewelery store somewhere on the rue du Faubourg St.Honore. 
The other visitors (occupants, regulars) of the cafe, friends of Volodya and Grigori Timofeevich, were deprived (without) such strong traces of individuality. They all drank alot, spent money, without counting, most of them had wives or lovers, of a very particular type - (ретушированной фотографии с обложки  дамского  журнала) like retouched photographs from the covers of woman's magazines, blondes in fur coats, bought through a connection from some desperate jew, who had already sent his family on to a safe place and now, risking his life, was selling everything, that had remained from his fur clothing store. The regulars (clients) of the cafe spent their entire day in waiting for another (consignment, batch, load) load of goods and in telephone conversations, in the evenings they played cards, winning and loosing huge sums. 
Grigori Timofeevich told me: 
I live well now, of course. But now I see (but all i've come to), that before I wished for the wrong things. Take, for example, one night I spent in Leon (Лионе), it was winter. No money, no work, no room. I spent the night at a construction site, at least it has a roof, at least the rain doesn't fall through. It was cold, nothing to cover myself with. I lay there then, you know, on the boards, and couldn't fall asleep, couldn't get warm - and I wished. There, I thought, an apartment that would be the thing for you Grigori Timofeevich, with damned central heating, and a bed with bed sheets. And in the evening your wife serving you food: sausage, appetizers, beefsteak. That would be the life. 
    His eyes became thoughtful.
    - And it turns out, that it was all wrong. That's it's not the (hitch,deal, matter) thing at all. Or rather, not only in that. In what - I don't know, only I know, that it's not in that. After all now I have all of that: I have an apartment and lunch and a wife, and even a bath - (живи,  не  хочу) and it should be the life, and  I don't want it. It turns out it's all not what it seems. Or so I think now. Take a person who gets into trouble, well, for example, poverty. He, this fool, thinks that that's the most important. That were there no poverty, everything would be great. Alright. Take him and like in a fairy tale, dress him, shoe him, gave him an apartment and everything else and said - well now live, be happy. And where is one supposed to get it? This happiness? In the bath? Here on my hand I have a gold watch "Longines", I bought it from Volodya. I paid as much for it, as in former times I wouldn't have used in a year. So I look at the arrows - what do they tell me? It's quite clear what: for you, Grigori Timofeevich, we count (keep track of) the time. It was five, and now it's six. That means, you have one hour less left to live. 
    And he really glanced at his watch. 
- Seven o'clock? One more hour less. But I'm not scared of it (frightened by). Only I regeret one thing: I've lived so many years and still don't understand (didn't come to know), what is human hapiness? So you've warmed yourself up, ate, had a drink - good. And what then? 
    It so happened (at one point it happened), that I did not visit the cafe for around two weeks. When I came it was an evening in late February. Grigori Timofeevich was not there, and when I asked about him, they told me, that he was sick, lying in bed. I went to see him, he lived not far from there.  
He lay in his bed, thinned out and unshaved, his eyes were (hot, feverish) and sad. Over his bed, under a lighted chandelier, the wings of Ruben's eagle shimmered with a blue light. I asked him, how he felt, he answered, badly. 
     - The blanket already feels heavy, he said, - that's the last thing (straw). It's the end for me. I'll die - and still I won't have known (know), what I needed in life. 
He died in the night, three days, I visited him. Volodya told me: 
    - Grigori Timofeevich passed away. Tomorow there will be a funeral service and a requiem. Will you come? The requeim will be at Grigori Timofeevich's apartment, four o'clock in the afternoon. 
Volodya never called Grigori Timofeevich anything other than Grisha or Grishka, I was even unsure, whether he knew his patronymic. And now there was an impression, that thre lived a Grisha, but there died a different person, Grigori Timofeevich. On the next day, when I arrived, I saw that the entire apartment of Grigori Timofeevich was cluttered with wreaths (flower). Where Volodya had acquired the flowers, in February of forty-three, in hunger filled Paris, and how much they had cost, I could not imagine. All the regulars of the cafe, the friends of Grigori Timofeevich, were already there, all of them had those metamorphized (Changed, altered), completely unrecognizable expressions, that people have in such circumstances. 
    - We are waiting for the (holy)father (priest), - Volodya said quietly. The holy-father, an old man with a (hoarse) voice raspy from a cold, arived in a quarter of an hour. He wore a shabby (worn) cassock (habit), and his (look) demanor was sad and weary (tired). He entered, crossed himself, and his lips soundlessly pronounced some kind of phrase. In the casket, covered in flowers, lay the body of Grigori Timofeevich, dressed in a black suit, and his dead eyes appeared as if they were looking into that sky, into which ascended Eagle, carrying away Ganimede. 
- From whereabouts is the deceased? - asked the priest.
Volodya answered - such and such county, Orlovskya region. 
    - A neighbor, then, - said the holyfather. - I am from those pats myself, it wouldn't even be thirty verst* distant. What a misfortune (tragedy), I didn't even know, I would have to lay to rest a fellow countryman. How was he called? 
    -Grigori.
The priest was silent for a time. It was clear, that this detail - that the deceased was from the same place as himsef, had made a significant impression. I even imagined, that he, maybe thought, so it has come turn for our own now. Then the priest let out a breath (sigh), crossed himself again and said: 
    - Were these different times, I would serve a real requiem, as they do in our monasteries. But only my voice is hoarse, it's too difficult for me alone, so help me God at least give a short requiem here. Maybe, someone here amongst you will help, (подтянет), поддержит меня?
I glanced at Volodya. The expression of his face was such, as I never could have imagined it - both tragic and exultant (solemn). 
    - Serve, holyfather, as you do in the monastery, - he said, - and we will (поддержим, support, backup) you, не собьемся.
He turned around towards his companions, lifted both hands into the air and with a ruling and (it seemed to me) familiar gesture, - the priest looked at him with surprise, - and the requiem began. 
Never and nowhere, not before, and not after have I ever heard such a chorus. After a little time had passed (shortly thereafter), the entire stairway of the house, in which Grigori Timofeevich lived, was full of people, that had come to listen to the singing (chorus). The raspy and melancholy voice of the priest was answered (returned) by the chorus, which was directed by Volodya. 
    "Воистину суета всяческая, житие же сень и соние, ибо всуе мятется всяк
земнородный, яко же  рече  Писание:  егда  мир  приобрящем,  тогда  во  гроб
вселимся, иде же вкупе цари и нищие".
    And then again the merciless reminder: 
    "Таков живот наш есть: цвет и дым и роса утренняя воистину: придите ибо
узрим на гробех ясно, где доброта телесная; где юность;  где  суть  очеса  и
зрак плотский; вся увядоша яко трава, вся потребишася".
    When I closed my eyes it began to seem to me, that the singing is a single might voice, rising and falling, and that it's vocal movements fill all the space around me. My eyes fell onto the casket and at that moment the chorus sang: 
    "Плачу и рыдаю, егда помышляю смерть и вижу во гробе лежащую, по образу
Божию созданную нашу красоту - безобразну, бесславну, не имеющую вида".
    "Cry and weep, for having thought of death and seen in the grave one lying, our beauty made in the image of God - abominable, shameless, (не имеющую вида)"  
Never before had a requiem seemed to me so tremendous, as on this gloomy winter day in Paris. Never before had I felt with such (convulsive) shocking force (strength), that in nothing else, maybe, hda human genius reached such terrific perfection
as in the harmoney of (раскаленных) scorching and truimphant (ascendent, торжественных) words in the movement of sounds, in which they occured. Never before had I understood with such penetrating hopelessness the unstoppable approach of death to all of those, whom I loved and knew and to whom the same prayer rose, which the chorus now sang: 
    "Со святыми упокой..."
