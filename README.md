Primarily I translate from Russian to English (and vice-versa on occasion). I am making an effort ( however it is slowing moving one) to get most of my translations up on the web. 

Any one is free to make use of the translations found here under the terms of  Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license.

If you find errors or have an interest in improving some of these translations, feel free to submit a pull request. I have made some effort to conserve editorial history.
