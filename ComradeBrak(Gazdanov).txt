Но как вино, печаль минувших дней В моей душе, чем старе, тем сильней.
     Пушкин
But just as wine, the grief of days gone-by, with time, grows stronger.  (But just as wine, with age grows stronger, so does the grief of gone-by days.) 
    Pushkin

    To me it had always seemed doubtless, that Tatyana Brak ought to have been born in a former time and in a different histroical setting. She would have spent her life on the soft couches of the nineteenth century, in carriages, harnessed with (лубочными) horses, on the decks of ships under (coquetish) the play of white sails. She would have taken a part in numerous intrigues, kept a saloon frequented by wealthy patrons - and died in poverty. But Tatyana Brak appeared only in the twentiethy century, and because of this, lived an entirely different live (прожила иначе); and with her biography are associated several bloody events, an unwilling participant of which became general Soikin, one of the meekest men, I had ever met. 
In those days, when Tatyana Brak began her (rueful, печальную) career, she was eighteen years old, and we admired (delighted in) her blonde (белыми) hair and (exceptional, astonishing) perfection of her body. She was a child born out of wedlock of a rich jewish banker and lived in her mother's apartment, a small, gray-haired woman, with kind eyes. 
The apartment was always a little dark; empty, gloomy paintings hung on the blue wallpaper, the dim (lusterless) wood of the grand piano faded into the darkness, on heavy bookstands, the golden back-edge's of books shimmered. Tatyana's mother gave lessons in music and french language. 
When Tatyana was approaching her ninteenth year, her eyes suddenly acquired a vague (dim) severity, we saw (presumed), that the sticky carpets of decadence were already being laid out under her feet. We were not wrong: One time Tatyana returned home long after midnight, we discovered (found out), that she had spent time first at the restaurant "Rumania", than in the hotal "Evropa"*, - in the company of a business man, Sergeev. There was every reason to be concerned about the consequences of her acquintance with Sergeev. General Soikin had warned us about it, an atheltic man of thirty-four years; he had not (at that meoment, back then) served in any army and was altogether (entirely вообще) not a military man: general was his nickname. We - consisted of (were) three people: Soikin, his friend (buddy, mate, приятель) Vila a former school-teacher, and I. 
    I would be unable to give an exact reason (cause), for the connection between our existence (lives) and that of Tatyana Brak. In this question we disagreed with Vila, the only one amongst us, with an inclination towards reasoning and analysis. He said, that there exist types of woman, that can embody in themselves an epoch, - and that in Tatyana Brak we loved that wavering (гибкое) mirror, that reflected everything, to which we were accustomed (с чем  мы  сжились ) and that was precious (dear, дорого) to us. Besides this, Vila maintained (asserted), we loved in in Tatyana Brak he extraordinary (unnatural, expectional) completeness (законченность), her firmness and certainty, in an unfathomable way (harmonized, in harmoney, compatible, joined with) femeninity and tenderness (gentleness, gentle manner). "That's all wrong, - the general would say, that's not what it's about (не в этом дело) Vila". 
I know, nevertheless, that general Soikin loved Tatyana with some-kind of extraordinary (exceptional), delicate love - I know also, that Tatyana Brak never suspected it. The general's love was (quite, entirely, did not resemble) unlike the romances of (развязных, flighty) promiscuos young people: even the thought of (the possibility of) having Tatyana, would probably, have horriffied him. The general loved Tatyana because, his selfless nature (character), having in life encountered only rudeness (coarseness, vulgarity) and (давку) (bustle) which offended him, had found in Tatyana-Brak some-kind of sentimental oasis. The general had loved music all of his life, sang romances and played the mandolin. And he understood, that his timid child-like humility, and romances, and the cheap mandolin - are not needed, maybe, by anyone; except for Tatyana when, who we often visited, asked him to sing something, it would suddenly seem to him, that he, the general, also exists in this world not in vain. And for the immesurabble joy, which he feel in such minutes, he would have given (away) everything. 
Vila was a person of an entirely indefinable type. He was moderately (decently, quiet) educated, but he did not have any of his own convictions (opinions), despite his passion towards philosophizing, not even habits, - decidely nothing of the sort, which distinguishes one person from another. His only quality was an organic fearlessness, and also, perhaps, an extraordinary (exceptional), and instinctive ability to orientate himself: I could not imagine, that Vila could get lose somewhere, or fail to find something. He and the general Soikin were connected by a five year old friendship and some-kind of old story (incident), about which neither the general, or nor he, were inclined to expatiate on (were wiling to, liked to talk about). At any rate, he followed the general everywhere: and in visits to Tatyana Brak he was our constant companion. 
And finally: was not Tatyana Brak the most brilliant heroine of our fantasies? We were bewitched (enchanted, charmed) by the winter and the strangeness of our lives; we were ready for any kind of trial (for all trial), we did not value neither our safety, or our repose; and after the stone figure of the general we would have went to defend (guard, protect) Tatyna Brak, the same way, as we may have went to conquer Australia or set fire to Moscow. 
On the otherhand: what was there for the general to protect? He had neither houses, nor lands, nor money, only a small mandolin, purchased by chance, and grief, illumed (lighted, illuminated) by a kerosene lamp. 
    But it was only later that we tried to understand (analyze) our love to Tatyana Brak: in former and better (More fortuante times) we could not think about it (something of the kind, like that). And in that moment, of which I write (relate), we were occupied by a single thought - how to rid Tatyana of businessman Sergeev. 
No one knew why he was a business man or what he sold: a large fraction of his time he spent with women, in theatres, at musical comedies (оперетке), in (café chantant's, chantants'*) on the utskirts of town; he was rumored to be, a participant in several very unseemly (actions, events), but he was an extremely slippery person, and there was nothing to directly accuse him off. He was well liked by women, I think, because, he spoke in a oversweetened tenor, had long eye lashes and an insurmountable (love, passion) towards quoting from Igor Severyanin*. A closer acquintance revelead that he was rather stupid, but with somekind of special, pretensious and coquetish, some-kind, as I would say of un-Russian stupidity. In deeds and in difficult circumstances he was, relentlessly, and brutally cruel: he would tell how he burned the hair on the body of one of his lovers - and for two weeks she was left unable to move. 
Even though we well knew, that Tatyana Brak, did not take well to advice, we sent Vila over to her with the task (errand) of warning her about the danger of meetings with Sergeev. Tatyana didn't finish listening to his evidence - and nearly threw him out of the apartment. 
    - No, - he said, sighing. - She is an exceptionally courageous (brave) lady. She is not even afraid of (венерических болезней, STD's venusian sickness). You know general, we won't be able to do anything like this. You talk to Sergeev in person. 
- Alright, I will speak to him personally, - the general said thoughtfully. 
That day had, in all, been one of the least fortunate in the life of Sergeev. One of his distant relations, a small, spiteful, and ragged hunchback, had come to see him demanding money; otherwise he would not leave. Sergeev always avoided expenditures, but in this case the stupid obstinacy (peristence) of the freak ( вывело его из себя) brought him to a rage. 
    - I'll throw you out of the window, - quietly and vehemently he told the hunchback. He (the other) began to whimper: 
    - Of course, it's not hard to throw out an invalid (убогого, wretched, poor man)! Give me some money!
    Sergeev gave him money; than he gave the dwarfs cheeks a good slapping (whipping) - and the dwarf, with a swollen face, on coming outside, started to chuck (throw) stones at Sergeev's windows and broke the glass, and when the (wild, mad from rage) Sergeev sprung out from the porch, the hunchback bolted away, quickly turning around with his entire body, to get a look a the persuer, showing him his tongue and spitting in all directs. The dwarf ran with a unccomon (exceptional, uncommon, astonishing) speed; he gave the impression of a deformed and frightful creature. Sergeev gave up the chase. 
In some unknown way, Vila found out, that Sergeev had arranged for a rendevous (date) with Tatyana on the eve, at night o'clock of the evening, at the same restaurant "Rumania". We decided (considered) that their (date, meeting) could not be allowed to happen and at eight o'clock the general Soikin left to parley personally with Sergeev. Sergeev sat in his room with, with broken windows, wrapped in a fur-coat, freezing and angry at the entire world. After a few words from the general, he (attacked) jumped at him with fisticuffs, but immedietly came to regret it, since the usually meek general, having laid his hopes on his diplomatic talent and least of all inclined to use a method of physical influence, suddenly (unexpectedtly) became enraged and frightening (terrifying). He broke countless vases with flowers, standing in Sergeevs room, broke arm-chairs, samshed the mirror, pulled down the carpets hanging on the walls and chucked them out of the window. Sergeev he almost choked to death: for a long time he dragged him around the ruined room, and the shards of vases cut into Sergeev's body; he shook him and threw him to the floor in desperation, - and when half an hour later he was leaving the room, Sergeev was lying silently on his back, his mouth open-wide showing his gold teeth. The general Soikin was met by Sergeev's neighbours (по меблированным  комнатам) from other furnished rooms, where all of this happened: they were armed with bottles, sticks, and other, more or less weighty objects, intended for defeating the general. The general quickly retreated, locked the door after himself, climbed out of the window and ran off. He came to see us looking very much downcast (glum). 
    Altogether, the entire life of Soikin was made up of countless disappointments. In principle he was a pacifist, he hated fights, held in contempt those, who turned to their fists (in arguments пускающих в ход  кулаки), and more than everything in the world loved (liked) polite conversations and the mandolin. In an idealic republic of humanism he would have been an examplary citizen. But akin to many others, - akin to Tatyana Brak, foor example, - he ended up in such circumstance, that were altogether non-conducive (at odds) to his innocent tastes (вкусам,harmless views). He was constantly attacked, someone would feel offended, or someone drunk would try to square accounts with him - and the peaceful Soikin would be forced to answer blows with blows; and since he possesed exceptional physical strength, these things alwys ended badly. On rare occasions, (впрочем) the general, despairing of the headstrong (peristent, obistnate, stubborn) disinclination for people to solve conflicts with polite conversations and mandolin music (игрой на мандолине), - the general, brought the brink by this animal-like torpor (?), would suddenly come into an ungovernable rage - and then even very brave people were afraid to approach him. Everytime after such incidents, arriving home, he would sigh, pitifully smack his lips and play the most minor-keyed melodies. 
So it happened this time as well. We were waiting for the general in his apartment: his apartment was located directly above the beaureau for funeral preparations, by which the general was constantly distressed; the apartment, the general valued because, the owner of the house, was a somewhat unusual person. He made a bet with one of his mates with the following terms: if within the span of one year he would not ask for rent, and yet there will inevitably be at least one person, who will still pay. The owner wasn't wrong: such a person turned out to be the general, who after this felt himself especially obligated to the owner and considered, (что он не вправе съезжать) that he didn't have a right to leave, especially since aside from the general, rent was decidely (definitevly) not paid by anyone else, not even by the owner of the funeral preperations bueraue, who was earning a large amount of money on the epidimic of spanish sickness (заработавший
большие деньги на эпидемии испанской болезни). 
    - People are such scum after all, - Vila was supportive. - Someone comes to have a dialogue (parley with them), and they turn to fisticuffs. (В  морду) A person like that deserves what's coming to them, that's clear enough. 
Since of Sergeev was deprived for a long time of the ability to schedule a rendevous, instead we made our way to the restaurant "Ruminia" ourselves. Tatyana Brak was already seated at a table, on the couch. She was in a dress with a large (?) décolletage. (libertine, Кутилы) with (проборами? hairstyle), (brilliantly, блистательно) pasing among lighter heads, apporoached to Tatyana Brak's table several times, but, on seeing the scowling face of the general, became disoncerted, backed away, nearly tripping over chairs, and wany away. Tatyana Brak (convulsed, grimaced) from anger and the long wait, but shame contained (fettered) her movements.  
    - Take a look, - said Vila, - there: love plays with a person.         - What are you mixing up? - melancholically asked the general. - Fate plays with a person, not love. And you were even a teacher once - so it's clear, how (unconscientious, undiligent, negligent) you were towards your obligations. What did you teach?
    - Geography, - said Vila. - And history in the lower grades. You're wrong to say that, general, that I was unconscientious in my obligations. Of course, if you play the mandolin, you should know "Burned and roared the Moscow Fire"* ("Горел-шумел пожар московский"). But if I asked you where, the Antillean islands are, than you'd say, in the Komstromskaya* (Костромской) region. 
    - Antillean or not, - who gives a damn (who the hell cares), - said the general.
    - Of course, with that kind of pessimism... And at that minute we noticed, that at Tatyana Brak's table sat down a stranger in riding-breeches. Vila looked reproachfully to the general. The stranger was saying sometehing quickly to Tatyana, without smiling. 
    He's working it cleanly, - I said, having gathered enough courage. 
    Vila called a lackey, thrust a bill (credit note, paper) into his hand, and asked him tell (на  ухо передать) Tatyana's interlocutar (companion) discreetly (confidentially) that one very interesting lady with a veil wants to see him for a minuate at the reception (waiting room). The general went tothe reception, and a couple seconds after him appeared Tatyana's interlocutor (companion, acquintance). He looked at the matte-red velvet of the door-curtains (портьер), took several looks around and was just about to leave, when the general stopped him. 
    - Excuse me, please, kind sir, - said the general, rewarding himself with this polite address for the beating of Sergeev, and sincerely pleased with his own tactfullness. - I ask you to excuse, that I, not having made your acquintance, have the indiscretion to address you. 
    - You are - the intriguing lady with the veil? - the stranger asked, smiling pridefully. 
    - Yes, and if you be so gracious as to excuse me for it...
    - What do you need? - the stranger said impatientl. 
    The general blushed (turned red), but restrained himself. 
    - Would you mind speaking in a somewhat lower voice? - he said apologetically. - I wanted to address (turn to you) with a request to leave the table with that young lady, with which you were (just) speaking. You see, I will tell you frankly: she is a very honest and entirely respectable young lady. After all you don't plan to marry her, no? And I am against, such, light connections (companionships, attachments, affairs), you know. 
    - And you are, who, by the way? 
    - You are straying from the topic, - the general objected. - What's important is, primarily, is principle. And details - are what? The details are entirely inconsequential. 
    - You must be drunk? 
    - You are not quite right. I, if you allow me to say, am quite sober. 
    - Than you're an idiot and a cad, - said the stranger, - I will teach you, not to interfere in other people's business. - The stranger swung. The general turned pale, caught his swinging hang, and, lifting the strange man into the air, opened the door and carried him outside. 
    - I was speaking to you, as one does with a person, - he said, looking into the astonished face of the stranger. - But if you do not know how to understand, than you must know how to feel. - The general tried to remember, how this was said in German, but his memory failed him. - I am warining you: if you do not leave this young lady alone and do not leave the restaurant within ten minutes, then you will regret it for the rest of your life. Do you understand? 
This time around the stranger appeared to understand, and barely had the general returned to the table, he was already gone. 
- And this one, like all the rest, - the general said wearily (dejectedly). When will people finally become decent?
