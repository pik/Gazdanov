Но как вино, печаль минувших дней В моей душе, чем старе, тем сильней.
     Пушкин
But just as wine with time grows stronger so does my soul's grief for gone-by days. (the grief i harbor in my soul for gone by days)
    Pushkin

To me it had always been clear and beyond a doubt that Tatyana Brak ought to have been born in a former time and in a different historical setting. She would have spent her life on the soft couches of the nineteenth century, in carriages, harnessed with (лубочными) horses, on the decks of ships under the play of white sails. She would have taken part in numerous intrigues, kept a saloon frequented by wealthy patrons - and died in poverty. Yet Tatyana Brak appeared only in the twentieth century and on account of this, lived an entirely different life; and with her biography are associated several bloody events, an unwilling participant of which became general Soikin, one of the meekest (most humble) men, I have ever met. 
In those days, when Tatyana Brak was only beginning her unfortunate (печальную) career (?), she was eighteen years old and we admired (found admirable) her blonde hair as well as the astonishing perfection of her body. She was a child born out of wedlock of rich jewish banker and lived in her mother's apartment,- a small, gray-haired woman, with kind eyes. 
The apartment was always a little dark; empty, dismal paintings hung over the blue wallpaper, the lusterless wood of the grand piano faded into the darkness, on heavy bookstands, the golden back-edge's of books shimmered. Her mother gave lessons in music and french language. 
When Tatyana was approaching her ninteenth year and her eyes suddenly acquired a dim harshness, we saw (became aware) that the sticky carpets of decadence were already being unfurled under her feet. We were not wrong: one time Tatyana returned home long after midnight, we discovered that she had spent time first at a restaurant "Rumania" and then in the hotel "Evropa"*, - in the company of a business man, Sergeev. There was every reason to be concerned about the consequences of her acquintance with Sergeev. General Soikin had warned us about it, an atheltic man of thirty-four years; he had not then served in any army and was altogether not a military man: general was his nickname. We - consisted of three people: Soikin, his mate Vila a former school-teacher, and myself.
I should be unable to give an exact reason for, the connection between our existences with that of Tatyana Brak. In this question we disagreed with Vila, the only one amongst us who had an inclination towards reasoning and analysis. He said that there exist types of women, which can embody in themselves an epoch, - and that in Tatyana Brak we loved that wavering (гибкое) mirror, that reflected everything, to which we were accustomed and that we held dear. Besides this, Vila maintained, we loved in in Tatyana Brak her unnatural perfection, her firmness and certainty, which in an unfathomable way was joined with femeninity and gentle manner. "That's all wrong", - the general would say, "that's not it at all, Vila". (a bunch of nonsense, got nothing to do with it)

Nevertheless, I know, that general Soikin loved Tatyana with some-kind of exceptional, delicate love - I know also, that Tatyana Brak never suspected of it. The general's love was unlike the usual romances of easy-going (promiscuous) young people: even to think of the possibility of having Tatyana, would probably have horriffied him. The general loved Tatyana because, his selfless nature, which having all his life encountered only vulgarity and force that offended him, had found in Tatyana Brak some-kind of sentimental oasis. The general had loved music all of his life, sang romances and played the mandolin. And he understood well enough that his timid child-like humility and romances, and the cheap mandolin - were not needed, maybe, by anyone; except for Tatyana when, who we often visited, would ask him to sing something and it would suddenly seem to him that he, the general, also had a purpose in this world. And for the immesurabble joy, which he feel in such minutes he could have given anything. 
Vila was a person of an entirely indefinable type. He was fairly educated, but he did not have any convictions which were his own, despite his passion towards philosophizing - not even habits, - decidely nothing of the sort, which distinguishes one person from another. His only quality was an organic fearlessness, and also, perhaps, an extraordinary and instinctive ability to orientate himself: I could not imagine that Vila could get lost somewhere, or fail to find something. He and the general Soikin were connected by a five year old friendship and some-kind of old story, regarding which neither the general nor he were inclined to expatiate on. At any rate, he followed the general everywhere: and in our visits to Tatyana Brak he was our constant companion. 
And finally: was not Tatyana Brak the most brilliant heroine of our fantasies? We were enchanted by the winter and the strangeness of our lives; we were ready for all trials, we had no value for our safety, or for repose; and we would have followed after the stone figure of the general to protect Tatyna Brak, in the same way, as we may have went to conquer Australia or to set fire to Moscow*. 
On the otherhand: what was there for the general to protect? He had neither houses, nor lands, nor money, only a small mandolin, purchased by chance, and grief, illumed by a kerosene lamp. 
But it was only later that we tried to understand our love toward Tatyana Brak: in former and better times we could not think about something of the kind. And in that moment, of which I write, we were occupied with a single thought - how to rid Tatyana of businessman Sergeev. 
No one knew why he was a business man or what he sold: a large fraction of his time he spent with women, in theatres, at musical comedies(oppereta's sоперетке), in café chantant's (chantants'*) on the outskirts of town; he was rumored to have been a participant in several very unseemly incidents but he was an extremely slippery fellow and there was nothing to directly accuse him of. He was well liked by women, I think, because, he spoke in a oversweetened tenor, had long eye lashes and an (seemingly) insurmountable passion towards quoting from Igor Severyanin*. A closer acquintance revealed that he was rather stupid, but with somekind of special, pretensious and coquetish, some-kind, as I would say brand of non-Russian stupidity. In deeds and in difficult circumstances he was, relentlessly and brutally cruel: he would tell how he burned the hair on the body of one of his lovers - and for two weeks she was left unable to move.
Even though we knew well enough, that Tatyana Brak, did not take (well) to advice, we sent Vila over to her with the task of warning her about the danger of meetings with Sergeev. Tatyana didn't finish listening to his arguments - and nearly threw him out of the apartment. 
- No, - he said, sighing. - She is an exceptionally courageous lady. She is not even afraid of (венерических болезней) STD's. You know general, we won't be able to do anything like this. You talk to Sergeev in person. 
- Alright, I will speak to him personally, - the general said thoughtfully. 
That day had, in all, been one of the least fortunate in the life of Sergeev. One of his distant relations, a small spiteful and ragged hunchback had come to see him demanding money- otherwise he would not leave. Sergeev always avoided expenditures, but in this case the stupid obstinacy of the freak brought him to a rage. (out of control вывело из себя)
- I'll throw you out of the window, - quietly and vehemently he told the hunchback. He began to whimper: 
- Of course, it's not hard to throw out wretched man such as myself! Give me some money!
Sergeev gave him money; then he gave the dwarfs cheeks a good whipping (work-over) - and the dwarf, on coming outside with a swollen face, started to throw stones at Sergeev's windows, breaking the glass, and when the Sergeev sprung out from the porch wild with rage, the hunchback bolted away, occasionally turning around with his entire body, to get a look ат his persuer, showing him his tongue and spitting in all directions. The dwarf ran with a unnatural speed, giving the impression of some deformed and frightful creature, and Sergeev (had to) gave up the chase. 
By some unknown way, Vila found out that Sergeev had arranged for a rendevous with Tatyana on the eve, nine o'clock at the same restaurant "Rumania". We decided that their rendevous could not be allowed to happen and at eight o'clock general Soikin left to parley personally with Sergeev. Sergeev sat in his room  with broken windows, wrapped in a fur-coat, freezing and angry at the entire world. After a few words from the general he jumped at him with fisticuffs but immedietly came to regret it, since the usually meek general, having laid his hopes on his diplomatic talent and least of all inclined to use a method of physical influence, suddenly became enraged and terrifying. He broke countless vases with flowers standing in Sergeev's room, broke arm-chairs, smashed the mirror, pulled down the carpets hanging along the walls and chucked them out of the window. He almost strangeled to Sergeev to death: for a long time he dragged him around the ruined room, while the shards of vases cut into Sergeev's body; he shook him and threw him to the floor in desperation, - and when half an hour later he was leaving the room, Sergeev was lying noiseless on his back, his mouth opened wide revealing his gold teeth. The general Soikin was met by Sergeev's neighbours from adjacent furnished rooms: (where all of this occurred): they were armed with bottles, sticks, and other, more or less weighty objects, prepared for defeating the general. The general beat a quick retreat (quickly rettreated) locking the door after himself, climbed out of the window and ran off. When he came to see us, he was very downcast. 
Altogether, the entire life of Soikin had been made up up of countless disappointments. In principle he was a pacifist, he hated fights, held in contempt those, who turned to their fists to settle disagreements, and more than everything in the world he loved (liked, prefered, adored) polite conversations and the mandolin. In an idealic republic of humanism he would have been an examplary citizen. But akin to many others, - akin to Tatyana Brak, for example, - he had ended up in circumstances that were altogether at odds with his innocent views. He was constantly attacked, someone would get offended, or someone drunk would try to settle (square, his) accounts with him - and the peaceful Soikin would be forced to answer blows with blows; and since he possesed extraordinary physical strength, these things always ended badly. On rare occasions, however, the general despairing of the obstinate (peristent, obistnate, stubborn, headstrong) unwillingness (disinclination) for people to resolve conflicts with polite conversations and mandolin music (игрой на мандолине), - the general brought to the brink by this animal-like torpor (?), would suddenly come into (be overtaken by) an ungovernable rage - and then even very brave people were afraid to approach him. Everytime after such incidents, arriving home, he would sigh, pitifully smack his lips and play the most minor-keyed melodies. 
So it had happened this time as well. We were waiting for the general in his apartment: his apartment was located directly above the beaureau for funeral preparations, (a fact which continously distressed the general) by which the general was constantly distressed; the general valued apartment because, the owner of the house, was a somewhat eccentric person. He had made a bet with one of his mates under the following terms: within the span of one year he would not ask for rent, and yet there would inevitably be at least one person, who would still pay. The owner wasn't wrong: such a person turned out to be the general, who after this felt himself especially obligated to the owner and considered, (что он не вправе съезжать) that he didn't have a right to leave, especially since aside from the general, rent was decidely not paid by anyone else, not even by the owner of the funeral preperations bueraue, who was earning a sizable income on the epidemic of spanish sickness (заработавший
большие деньги на эпидемии испанской болезни). 
    - People are such scum after all, - Vila was supportive. - Someone comes to have a dialogue with them, and they turn to fisticuffs. Right in the muzzle - that's what good for them. 
Since Sergeev was deprived of the ability to schedule a rendevous for a long time, we made our way to the restaurant "Ruminia" ourselves instead. Tatyana Brak was already seated on a couch at a table. She was wearing a dress with a large décolletage. Libertines (Кутилы) with (проборами? hairstyle), brilliantly pasing among lighter heads, apporoached Tatyana Brak's table several times, but on noticing the scowling face of the general, became disconcerted, backed away nearly tripping over chairs, and went off. Tatyana Brak grimaced (convulsed) from anger and the long wait, but the shame restrained (fettered, contained) her movements.  
    - Take a look, - said Vila, - there: love plays with a person. - What are you mixing up? -  the general asked melancholically. - Fate plays with a person, not love. And you were even a teacher once - so it's clear, how unconscientious you were towards your obligations. What did you teach?
    - Geography, - said Vila. - And history in the lower grades. You're wrong to say that, general, that I was unconscientious in my obligations. Of course, if you play the mandolin, you should know "Burned and roared the Moscow Fire"* ("Горел-шумел пожар московский"). But if I asked you where, the Antillean islands are, than you'd say, in the Komstromskaya* (Костромской) region. 
    - Antillean or not, - who gives a damn, - said the general.
- Of course, with that kind of pessimism... And at that minute we noticed, that at Tatyana Brak's table a stranger in riding-breeches had sat down. Vila looked reproachfully to the general. The stranger was saying sometehing quickly to Tatyana, without smiling. 
He's working it cleanly, - I said, having gathered enough courage. 
Vila called a lackey, thrust a bill into his hand and asked him discreetly inform Tatyana's interlocutar that one very intriguing lady with a veil wants to see him for a minute in the waiting room. The general went to the waiting room and a couple seconds after him Tatyana's new acquintance appeared. He looked at the matte-red velvet of the door-curtains, took several looks around and was just about to leave, when the general stopped him. 
- Excuse me, please, kind sir, - said the general, rewarding himself with this polite address for the beating of Sergeev, and sincerely pleased with his own tactfullness. - I ask you to excuse, that I, not having made your acquintance, have the indiscretion to address you. 
    - You are - the intriguing lady with the veil? - the stranger asked, smiling pridefully. 
    - Yes, and if you be so gracious as to excuse me for it...
    - What do you need? - the stranger said impatiently. 
    The general blushed, but restrained himself. 
- Would you mind speaking in a somewhat lower voice? - he said apologetically. - I wanted to address you with a request: to leave the table with the young lady to whom you were just speaking. You see, I will tell you frankly: she is a very honest and entirely respectable young lady. After all you don't plan to marry her, no? And I am against, such, light connections, you know. 
- And you are, who, by the way? 
- You are straying from the topic, - the general objected. - What's important is, primarily, is principle. And details - are what? The details are entirely inconsequential. 
    - You must be drunk? 
    - You are not quite right. I, if you allow me to say, am quite sober. 
    - Than you're an idiot and a cad, - said the stranger, - I will teach you, not to interfere in other people's business. - The stranger swung. The general turned pale, caught his swinging hang, and, lifting the strange man into the air, opened the door and carried him outside. 
    - I was speaking to you, as one does with a person, - he said, looking into the astonished face of the stranger. - But if you do not know how to understand, than you must know how to feel. - The general tried to remember, how to say this in German, but his memory failed him. - I am warning you: if you do not leave this young lady alone and do not leave the restaurant within ten minutes, then you will regret it for the rest of your life. Do you understand? 
This time around the stranger appeared to understand, and barely had the general returned to the table, he was already gone. 
- And this one, like all the rest, - the general said wearily (dejectedly). When will people finally become decent? 
    The evening came to a succesful end. Tatyana Brak went home. We followed her along the firm, squeeking snow, through the clouds of white icy dust. The wind rustled veiling the streetlights with their trembling (shivering, wavering) flame; 
    in the long gallery, of lonely white lights, moved several black figures, past the slowly fading multi-storied stone icebergs. 
Many years later, general Soikin told me, that the most significant factor that influenced 
Tatyana Brak, he considered to be purely the atmospheric conditions - the temperature, twenty degreees * below zero, the dry freezing winter and the extraordinary (uncommon) clarity of the icy air, typical to this period of time (for this period of the season).
    - Now, - he said, - when so much water has passed, we can witness to these things impartially. 
Perhaps, the general was right. At any rate, the black silhoutte of Tatyana Brake, walking past the white street-lamps, remained for us one of the most convincing, one of the most beautiful images among our memories. "I did not forget, I told the general, - I never will be able to forget, everything that happened that winter in our city. Do you remember, general, that even the romance "You'll forget a little on a winter night", ("чуть  позабудешься  ночью морозною") which you played then on the mandolin, and which of course, could not stand up to criticism here, in the unpoetic west, back then seemed to us to be filled with deep meaning. We were altogether better back then, general. Remember those extraordinary snowy pyramids of trees, the lamps of the restaurants, where speculators gathered, that rarefied and sharp wind of freedom and the wind orchsetra of the revolution, which to you, as musician, should be especially dear (close). Of course, this romanticism has vanished entirely without a trace and perhaps only Tatyana Brak could again revive before us this desert poetry, in the blue whiteness of which, we continue (?) to hear the truimphant music of that time. But Tatyana Brak, deplorably, is dead - and you prefer your mandolin, general? 
- No, why the mandolin? - said the general. - I even, if you'd like to know, prefer the grand piano. 
    - Yes, the grand piano is also a good thing. Do you remember, who played the grand piano well, general? 
    - Lazar Rashevsky? 
I nodded my head. Lazar Rashevsky was the person who had doomed Tatyana Brak. We never denied his merits: courage, rhetorical talent and a great musical gift. But his long, thin, flexible frame, unusually thin and sticky fingers, his rapid, monkey-like gestures, were organically repulsive to us. The general could not reconcile himself, to his severe, abrupt, caustic comments and his complete indifference to the rules of deceny. Vila held contempt for him on account of his inadequate knowledge of history. And I in my turn, also had a reason to have little liking for Lazar: I could not forgive his readiness to submit, with absurd precision, to a politcal doctrine. It was true, that fate had not been kind to him: the winter of nineteen-nineteen he was hung on the orders of general Sivyhin as a Mahnovsky* spy, on the railroad bridge of the Cinelnikovo station. But of his death, and courageous conduct as a prisoner of the whites we were told of only later by Vila. 
Lazar Rashevsky, who none of us knew at the time, had made Tatyana Brak's acquintance at a political meeting, where he spoke in favor (as a defender, propnent) of anarchism. Tatyana never explained what she liked him for but when we came to see her once, we saw Lazar, sitting in a chair with such an air as if he had been a regular visitor to their household for at least ten years. We exchanged glances. 
    - Comrade Brak, - said Lazar; his voice was very sharp (shrill): he 'burred' (? картавил) the letter "R". - I forgot to tell you, I think: you have a (destined, fated) last-name. More than that, comrade Brak sounds like a paradox*. - Tatyana did not give an answer. Lazar's eyes stopped on the grand piano - And you, play music? Do you play well? I also play well. 
- Well, why don't you play, - the general who had been silent up to now said distrustfully. Lazar sat down at the grand piano and we heard such music as we had never heard before. The general blinked in perplexity - and when afterwards Tatyana asked him to sing something on the mandolin, he, neglecting even his courteous manner, usually entirely faultless, refused in the most categorical way. 
In the first day of our meeting we learned everything, that there was to learn about Lazar. He was an anarchist-teorrorist, had lived in France for a long time and only arrived in Russia a few weeks ago. Here he planned to establish an organization of comrades to fight against the government and expropriation. One should give credit to his energy; within ten days an organization was established,  Lazar had obtained machine-guns somewhere, and to our surprise, it become known that comrade Brak was elected the secretary of the "eighth section of the All-Russian party of anarchist-terrorists". 
On a deep december night the combat unit of the eighth section rode out into the streets, than took a right turn and began to rise towards the aristocratic neighbourhood of the city. The unit was armed with rifles, revolvers and two machine-guns. It consisted of ten people and at the head of the unit, next to Lazar Rashevsky, clumsily clutching the mane of a horse with her frozen fingers, rode comrade Brak. The shadow of the black flag* dragged along the down-trodden snow. 
According to the resolution of the financial comittee, they were to expropriate the monetary reserves of an (анонимного общества банка Кернер) of the bank Kerner and K*. They had already finished loading the spoils onto the cart, when we heard desperate shooting. At the time we were sitting in general Soikin's apartment and having a very peaceful conversation. On hearing gunfire, we came out onto the street. Machine-gun fire resounded half a block away from us, beyond a corner and before we had time to take as steps, Tatyana Brak galloped past us on a horse. We gazed after her dumbstruck. The shooting hadn't come to an end. Another minute later Lazar Rashevsky ran by with a revolver hand. We went in the direction of the noise.
By the doors of the (анонимного общества) four men stood looking down at two policemen who had been killed, - although there wasn't much to look at: they were both dead. The snow was imprinted with numerous horseshoe prints. Everything was easily accounted for: the police, hurried to the bank, to arrest the anarchists, and were met with machine-gun fire. Two policemen were killed, four were wounded, and the anarchists, every single one of them, not only escaped, but got away with everything they had expropriated.
From those days the name of comrade Brak became well-known. A few days after the robbery of the (анонимного общества) another expropriation occured, and again there were human casualties. In our presence, legends were told (related) about comrade Brak, which painted her in grimmest colors. Her mother cried for whole days straight. Tanya did not return home, - and none of us knew a thing about her whereabouts. Then Vila, who possesed a dog-like sense, took on the task of locating comrade Brak. He spent three days roaming about the city, after which he came to us, and said that he had not found Tatyana, but he knew, where Lazar could be found (a place that he frequents). 
    - You know, It's such a conspiracy, - Vila told the general. - It's almost comical. Well Lazar can be found in the (паштетной) of the formerly owned by Dodonov (бывшего Додонова).
    With the (паштетной), formerly owned by Dodonova, we were well acquianted. It was kept by a bookbinder Vanya, a quiet and suspicious man. But for the last three weeks the (паштетной) had been closed, even Vanya had vanished and no one knew where - and we were surprised: when it opened again. We went there the same evening.
The (Паштетной) could not be recognized. From a regular den with dirty oil-cloth on the tables, and fly filled decanters, it had turned into a clean restaurant with serious pretentions towards eastern style. We entered, looked around, and saw eight customers (clients, visitors), all of whom we knew - and about who, not all-together, but about each one (especially) singally, not one of us had a good thing to say. Lazar wasn't there.  
We sat down at the table and ordered a bottle of lemonade, to which the fellow, who looked more like an eastern conjurer than a lackey, with a head wrapped in a green rag and a dark face (mottled, dappled) covered in smallpox, - and snorted contemptuously, right in Vila's face. The general traded glances with Vila and stepped on the lackeys foot, pressing his foot down with such force, that the dark face under the green material turned purple from pain. Vila, reeling his char back, poked the lackey in the stomach with his fist: the lackey doubled-over and dropped his tray, which had been, entirely empty. Vanya gave a mirthless smile from behind the bar-stand.
- My fellow, you should be more courtous with the customers, - the general said softly. - If they order lemonade, that means, lemonade. And that idiotic snorting is quiet unnecessary. 
The lackey walked away with an unsteady (uneven) gait. The other occupants looked at the general, but did not say anyhing. 
Five minutes later Lazar arrived. "Comrade Rashevsky!" - yelled the general. - "Can I have a couple words a with you?" And the general explained to Lazar, that comrade's Brak mother is simply killing herself over it (, "очень убивается", is coming apart, really distraught) and it would be good, if Tatyana visted her at home: he the general, would guarantee the inviolability (sanctity, immunity) (for, of) comrade Brake. Lazar made a wry face, as if he had just biten a lemon, and replied:
- I cannot permit comrade Brak to do this. You know, comrade, this stupid sentimentalism (should/ought to be set aside, done away with). First it's the mother, then the brother, then the father-in-law... I cannot permit it. 
    - Please, it would be a great favor, - the general persisted. 
    - I said no, which means, no. 
- Well, then, - said the general, - I won't let you go, until comrade Brak doesn't visit her mother. 
Lazar laughed - and wanted to get-up from the table. But the general held him: 
- No, comrade Rashevsky, you won't leave like that. - And Lazar's face turned serious. He tried to bolt from the table, but the general's grip remained firm. - There is one more option, - the general said. Take us to comrade Brak, we will talk with her. 
- That I can do - Lazar answered. We left through the backdoor of the joint (паштетной), crossed the street and entered (arrived at) a lighted six story building with numerous apartments. Lazar stopped on the third floor, opened the door with a key, and invited us to enter. In the drawing-room, on the couch sat two woman and two men, - and from afar we could see the blond hair of comrade Brak. 
Half an hour later, Tatyana, wrapped in a fur-coat, was leaving her room. 
    - Where are you going? - asked Lazar. 
    - I will be back soon. 
    - I didn't give you permission.  
    - I didn't ask for for your permission. Lazar, usually audacious (?)  and quick to answer, was a (bit) rather put out this time. 
    - Excuse me. (Sorry) 
    And we arrived at Tatyana Brak's former apartment. Her mother cried from joy, kissing Tatyana without stop and berating her: 
    - Have pity on me, Tanechka*, I will cry for you. Well, what will I live for, if you should persish? 
    - I can't, mama, - said Tatyana, - it has to be like this, nothing to be done about it. 
    (Лицо  матери  скрылось  в  морщинах) The mothers face disappeared in wrinkles and quietly she began to weep. The general frowned (stronger verb!?) and an uncertain (?) despair appeared in his eyes. Vila swallowed his saliva and I looked into the darkened window: improbable patterns of frost shone infront of me; cold blew from a crack.
    - Well, Christ be with you, Tanechka, - her mother said.
    On the way back, bouncing in the sled, the general began to speak multiple times: 
    - Ah, comrade Tanya... ah, comrade Tanya... - but from anxiety was unable to say anything. 
    - Good talk, nothing to say (нечего сказать), - Vila said (archly, mockingly). The general turned towards his eyes towards him infuriated, but Vila quickly jumped back (out of reach).
    - (Твое счастье) You're okay, - the general said, relaxing. - Understand Vila, it's a pity. 
Afterwards (later, then, thereafter) the combat unit of anarchist-terrorists left our city. This coincided with the arrival of the Red Army. They appeared in the white morning mist, after a (пустынной) lonely temperizing (выжидающей) night, drowned the city in furry, (заиндевевшими, hoar-covered) rimy hides of horses, flat noses of soldiers, red stars of commisars and the painted faces of prostitutes (высыпавших  на  улицы), pouring into the streets in this late (at least for prositutes) hour. Regiments of motley (пестро) dressed people passed by boarded-up stores; proud stand rd-bearers dragged on their shoulders thin sticks with pieces (fragments, rags) of red cloth (материи); truimphant officers, with faces overflowing with pleasure, walked out of formation, along the sidewalks, and smiled (obligingly, любезно) at the sensitive (чувствительным взглядом горничных) gazes of chambermaids, courtesans, and market-women with red hands and hoarse (racuous,raspy) throats. A bustling (суетливая толкотня) was on-going i nthe city: within a couple of hours multiple buildings were reserved, legions of young ladies began to knock (застучали) away at type-writers, depicting in themselves an ideal connceted ribbon of lips (представлявших  из  себя  идеальное  соединение  ленточек  губ), cheery (веселеньких) noses and eyes and (всякого усердия) (zeal, eagerness) in service to the proletariat and Internationale, these mysterious foreign words, in which, in essence, (ремингтонистки) не обязаны разбираться. This was an army of soviet saints: the general and I loved (adored) it's (happy-go-lucky thoughtlessness), the lack of comprehension (understanding) of numerous things, the blissful ignorance and simplicity of soul, which serve as (контрамарка) free pass for entrance int othe giant circus of the heavenly kingdom. Vila, more demanding (exigent, fastiduous), contemptuously (derrided) called the (ремингтонисток) (половыми функциями государственного аппарата). The city coughed, sighed - and went back to its former life; but we could not regain (peace, comfort, order tranquility): comrade Brak was gone. 


    - But where are you going? 
    - In an unknown direction (В неизвестном направлении), - said the general. 
    But we were fated to be late - and always after this the general with hatred would remember the cruel mistake of time, besides he would curse (swear at) time, as if this collosal (immense, tremendous) and noisy notion (idea, concept) were a living man, who had caused us (unprecedented, un-heard-of, unimaginable) (insult, outrage, offense).
    We were late - and, approaching the Pavlograd station, learned an stunning piece of news ( узнали  ошеломляющую новость): a punitive troop (squadron) of government forces, headed by (at the head of which) was comrade Sergeev had captured anarchist Brak's unit. The unit was executed (расстреляна), only one person escaped - Lazar Rashevsky. For a long time the general sat (silent, without speaking) on the long bench in the third class hall (?). Then we went out into the field, saw the corpses (bodies) and somewhat to the side of them, - the body of comrade Brak. She lay in pnatalons and a shirt. "Мертвые срама не имут!" - yelled Vila. Comrade Brak's head was shattered (smashed) by bullets: one bullet had entered (into her underarm, armpit), and 
    frozen hairs и на (вывороченном мясе торчали обледеневшие волосы). The white legs of comrade Brak (spread out, stretched out) on the frozen snow: in her half-opened mouth, darkened a (остановившийся) small tongue. 
    - Probably, comrade Sergeev is still at the station,- the general said. Vila jumped aside when he heard these words, although the general spoke quietly and distinctly (calmly). 
    Indeed, comrade Sergeev had not left yet. A first-class car stood on the second line of tracks, under guard by a gangling (lanky) sentry. We walked around the station building. The entire troop had left for the city to raid the large wine storehouse, and at the station remained only comrade Sergeev and the sentry. The general, without thinking, approached the car, - and the sentry blocked his path. 
- No entry here, comrade, - he said. The cleanly shaved face of Sergeev (appeard for a moment, could be glimpsed) in the window. 
- No entry,  - the sentry repeated, but, looking at the general, lowerd his voice and whispered: - I'll yell for help. 
The general snatched (wrested, tore) the rifle from his hands and hit him with a full swing to the face. The sentry slumped (?): his back began to slide down the laquared wood of the car (train-car), his legs fell into the snow, and his blood covered head quietly thuncked against the tracks. The general entered the car. Sergeev on seeing him, grabbed his revolver, but didn't have time to draw it: the general's fingers seized his hand. 
    - You executed comrade Brak, - the general said. Sergeev silently and desperately looked around (was looking around). - You cannot imagine, what kind of person this was, - the general said and sobbed. he released Sergeev's right hand, which hung down limply; its pale fingers did not move. Then he took Sergeev's neck with both hands and began to squeeze slowly. Sergeev turned crimson and began to twitch (задергался). 
    - Don't resist, - said Vila entering the train-car, - he's physically a very strong person, I mean to say, general Soikin. I even, you know, one time made a wager with him... - Tears appeard in Sergeev's eyes. - You think, I didn't cry? - said the general.  Half a minute later, the business man, don-juan, and commander of a punitive troop Sergeev, no longer existed: in his train-car lay a corpse with (выкатившимися) eyes and deep blue finger marks on his neck.
    My god -, mumbled the general, - what savagery!... (какая жестокость) 
    And we disappeared in the dark mists of those discordent times (смуты). We were flung from place to place, through crackling and whistling (of bullets?). Covered in earth and sparks, we blundered along and dying, our eyes clutched at the empty blue limit of skies, at shooting stars, falling down from terrible astronomical heights. We lived in smoking snows and shelled pump-stations, we crossed countless bridges, collapsing under our very feet; we entered large bustling cities, rattling with doomed orchestras and cheery arias of operretas (musical comedies) (дребезжавшие  обреченными  оркестрами веселые  арии  опереток); we saw improbable women (unbelievable, невероятных  женщин?), giving themselves for a pair of english shoes, on the gloomy slopes of coal piles in railway stations, we saw mad cows and insane priests, - we glanced far (into the heavy book of time) through the heavy pages of time: (десятки искалеченных Богемий покорно умирали перед нами:) 
    people, swinging from tall russian crossbars, stared silently at us. 
And Lazar Rashevsky did not survive the voyage. He was captured by white* soldiers and charged (accused of) with espionage. And he, stripped, was driven in a heated-goods-van with a flaming stove to the headquarters of general Sivyxin, they beat his shaved head with a red-hot ramrod, but he did not give anyone away. Morning of the next day he was to be hung. He met death courageously, did not sigh, or plead. But nearness of the end forced him, I think, to feel regret for Tatyana Brak and her death for which he was at fault. And Lazar performed a sentimental act, which he may have regreted himself (come to regret), had he remained alive. He asked, to be brought to general Sivyhin, saying that he wanted personally to communicate to him several important pieces of information. But this was untrue. He stopped before the gray-haired man, with a square-skull and said in his (shrill? sharp) voice: 
- Sir general, tomorow I will be hung. - The general nodded. - I would like to ask you for one favor. In your train there is a grand piano - I heard, how someone was playing it. I am a very good pianist, sir general, allow me to play something this evening. 
    - Play as much as you'd like, - said the general. When Vila told us about this, I was sitting, with my head down, and trying very hard to remember something. And only when Vila stopped speaking before my eyes appeared the line out of Andre Chenier: 
    - "Au pied de 1'echafaud j'essaye encore ma lyre *1"
Lazar Rashevsky played the entire evening. I don't know how he played, I think much worse than he usually would (was usuall, than normally). Его  слушали   генеральские   сестры милосердия в белых  косынках  с  крестиками  и  штабные  офицеры. Everyone was moved, the sister's even cried into their handkerchiefs. 
    - And still justice must be served first, - said the general: and on the next day Lazer was hung on a railroad bridge, with a note pinned to his chest: 
    "For espionage on behalf of the bandit and anarchist Makhno*". 
And so, - heroic saga's come to an end, and far too much water flows by, - as the general would say, - and we again repose in our beggarly well-being. The general spends his time composing lyrical obituaries,  Vila is studying the history of parliamentarism. And I, see - the black silhoutte of comrade Brak rising from rubbish of former calendars, passing through deserted streets.
